# Book 1: The Dance of Life and Death
## Chapter 10: The Long Retreat

The first assault came at midnight on the third day of the siege.

Kaelen jerked awake at the sound of alarms, already reaching for his swords before his eyes fully opened. Outside his barracks window, the night sky lit up with magical fire—reds and blacks and sickly greens that meant void energy.

"UP!" he shouted to the other Vanguard members sleeping nearby. "THEY'RE ATTACKING!"

He ran through the corridors pulling on armor, buckling sword belts, his mind still fuzzy with interrupted sleep but his body moving on pure combat instinct. By the time he reached the eastern wall, the battle was already raging.

Demons swarmed the walls like angry ants, using those void-powered siege ladders that seemed to extend impossibly high. Alliance defenders fought desperately to push them back—pouring oil, dropping stones, firing arrows into the mass of corrupted flesh below.

Lyra was already there, her bow singing its deadly song. Each arrow found a target—demons fell from ladders, clutching at shafts protruding from eyes or throats. Her face was set in grim concentration, mechanical precision overriding any emotion.

"Status!" Kaelen demanded, taking position beside her.

"Three assault points on the eastern wall, two on the southern!" she reported without pausing her shooting. "They're coordinating—hitting us from multiple angles to divide our forces!"

Drakon roared somewhere to the left, and Kaelen saw flames erupt as the dragon prince transformed partially, incinerating a section of demons that had actually made it onto the wall. His draconic laughter echoed across the night.

"IS LIKE SHOOTING PRACTICE BUT DEMONS ARE THE TARGETS!" he bellowed joyfully.

"He's having too much fun with this," Lyra muttered.

"At least someone is."

Kaelen moved along the wall, organizing defenders, plugging gaps in the line. His awakened senses tracked everything—demon positions, weak points in their assault, where reinforcements were needed. The power Aric had helped him unlock was fully integrated now, no longer something separate but part of who he was.

A demon champion—one of those elite warriors in bone armor—crested the wall near him. Kaelen engaged immediately, his twin swords moving in patterns that Aric had burned into his muscle memory. The champion was fast, strong, experienced.

Kaelen was faster.

Silver energy flickered along his blades as he struck—throat, hamstring, armpit, all the gaps in armor. The champion fell in seconds, ichor pooling beneath its twitching corpse.

"NICELY DONE, SWORD-BROTHER!" Drakon appeared beside him, grabbing another demon and literally throwing it off the wall. "Is very efficient kill! Aric would be proud!"

"Less talking, more throwing demons!"

"Can do both! I am excellent multi-tasker!"

The assault lasted two hours before the demons pulled back, leaving Alliance casualties and corpses scattered across the battlements. Kaelen helped with triage—separating wounded who could be saved from those who couldn't, a grim calculus he'd learned to make without thinking too hard about it.

Elfiria appeared with the healers, her hands glowing with divine light as she moved from wounded soldier to wounded soldier. Each healing drained her visibly—her divine aura dimming, dark circles deepening under her eyes.

"You need to pace yourself," Kaelen said when she reached him, swaying with exhaustion.

"There are still wounded."

"There are always wounded. You'll be useless if you burn yourself out."

She looked like she wanted to argue, but ultimately nodded and let him guide her away from the walls. They found a quiet corner in a guard tower, and she collapsed against him.

"This is just the first assault," she said quietly. "They'll keep coming, night after night, wearing us down."

"Then we keep fighting, night after night."

"For how long? How long can we hold?"

Kaelen didn't have a good answer to that.

---

The pattern established itself over the next week: demon assaults at irregular intervals, designed to deny defenders rest, to exhaust them slowly. Sometimes the attacks came twice in one night. Sometimes they'd wait two days before the next assault, lulling defenders into relaxing their guard.

It was psychological warfare, and it was working.

"We're losing people not just to combat but to exhaustion," Archmage Selene reported in a war council six days into the siege. "Soldiers falling asleep at their posts, making mistakes, reaction times slowing. We need more defenders or fewer assault points."

"We have what we have," King Aldric replied tiredly. "Redistribute forces from the quieter sections to the hot spots."

"We're already doing that. The demons adapt—they hit wherever we're weakest."

"Then we adapt better."

The arguments went in circles, everyone exhausted, no one with good solutions.

Kaelen left the council early, too frustrated to listen to more circular debate. He found Lyra on the walls, watching the demon camp fires in the distance.

"Council productive?" she asked without looking at him.

"About as productive as arguing with a brick wall."

"So very Alliance leadership of them." She lowered her bow—she'd been on watch for six hours straight. "We can't keep this up, Kaelen. The math doesn't work. They have sixty thousand demons who don't need sleep. We have maybe eight thousand effective defenders who are exhausted."

"I know."

"So what do we do?"

"Same thing we've been doing. Hold the line. Buy time."

"For what? What are we buying time for?"

Kaelen didn't answer, because he didn't know. They were just... surviving. One assault at a time. One night at a time.

Lyra seemed to read his thoughts. "We need a win. Something to boost morale, show we're not just sitting here waiting to die."

"What do you suggest?"

"Counterstrike. Hit their siege equipment, disrupt their organization. Make them respect us again."

"That's suicide."

"Better than slow death by siege." Lyra finally looked at him. "Talk to Drakon and Elfiria. If anyone can pull off a crazy raid, it's the Trinity plus one glowing priestess."

---

They planned the raid that night—the four of them plus Gorim and a handful of elite soldiers. The target: the demon siege engines positioned on the eastern approach. Destroying them would cripple the demon's ability to assault that section of wall.

"This is very stupid plan," Drakon said cheerfully as they prepared. "I love it very much!"

"It's a terrible plan," Elfiria corrected. "But better than doing nothing."

"That's what I said! Is stupid but excellent!"

They waited until 3 AM—the dead hour when even demons seemed to get sluggish. Then they slipped out through a sally port on the northern wall, circled around through ruined outer city districts, and approached the siege engines from an unexpected angle.

Lyra went first, her elven stealth and ranger training making her nearly invisible in the darkness. She took out sentries silently, clearing a path.

Then Kaelen, Drakon, and the assault team moved in fast.

The siege engines were massive constructs of corrupted wood and void energy, pulsing with sickly green light. Kaelen didn't understand how they worked and didn't care. They just needed to burn.

Drakon provided the fire. Lots of fire.

Alarms went up almost immediately—demons responding to the attack with frightening speed. Kaelen and the assault team fought to buy Drakon time, his twin swords blurring as he engaged demons with awakened speed.

Elfiria hung back, providing support—divine light that weakened demons, healing for wounded soldiers, shields that blocked void energy attacks. She was a force multiplier, turning good fighters into devastating ones.

The siege engines caught fire beautifully, void energy reacting explosively to dragon fire. Explosions lit up the night as corrupted wood shattered.

"TIME TO GO!" Kaelen shouted.

They ran, demons pursuing in force. Lyra covered their retreat with precision shots that dropped pursuers. Gorim held rear guard with his spear, the dwarf's defensive skills buying crucial seconds.

They made it back to the sally port with zero casualties—a miracle by any standard.

"THAT WAS EXCELLENT!" Drakon declared once they were safe. "We should do again tomorrow!"

"Let's not push our luck," Kaelen replied, checking everyone for wounds.

But Lyra had been right—the raid boosted morale significantly. Word spread through the defenders: the Trinity had struck back, destroyed demon equipment, escaped without losses. It was a small victory, but victories had been scarce.

For a day, hope burned brighter.

Then General Malakor himself led the next assault, and everything went to hell.

---

Malakor's presence on the battlefield was like reality taking a sick day. Her void aura warped the air, made stone walls feel less solid, turned courage into fear.

She stood before the eastern gate with her shadow blade drawn, facing thousands of defenders, and smiled.

"ALLIANCE OF LIGHT!" her magically amplified voice rang out. "I am impressed by your persistence! Most mortals surrender after a week! You have lasted nearly two!"

"Is she praising us?" Lyra asked from the walls above.

"I think so?" Kaelen replied, unsure.

"Your little raid on our siege equipment was delightfully audacious!" Malakor continued. "So I decided to handle this assault personally! Please try to entertain me! I so rarely get proper challenges anymore!"

Then she attacked the gate.

Her shadow blade cut through reinforced wood like it was paper. Defensive wards shattered on contact with void energy. In seconds, she'd carved a hole large enough for demons to pour through.

"DEFEND THE BREACH!" someone screamed.

Kaelen was already moving, leaping from the wall to the courtyard below, landing in a crouch and sprinting toward the gate. Behind him, the Vanguard followed—Lyra, Drakon, Gorim, every elite fighter who could respond.

They hit the demon wave pouring through Malakor's breach like a hammer striking an anvil. The fighting was vicious, close-quarters, no room for technique—just raw violence and desperate defense.

Kaelen fought in a trance state, his blades extensions of will. Demons fell, but more kept coming. Beside him, Drakon transformed fully into his massive draconic form, using sheer size to block the breach physically.

Lyra fired from the walls, her arrows finding any demon that got past Drakon's massive bulk.

And Elfiria—she appeared in a burst of divine light, the Holy Dome artifact blazing in her hands. She channeled its power directly at Malakor.

The Herald of Despair actually staggered back, her shadow blade flickering.

"Impressive!" Malakor laughed. "The vessel herself joins the fight! This is excellent!"

They dueled—divine light against void shadow, priestess against Demon General. Elfiria was outmatched in raw combat ability but the Holy Dome's power equalized things. Light and shadow clashed, reality warping around their battle.

Kaelen wanted to help but couldn't reach her—too many demons between them, too much chaos.

Then Malakor struck Elfiria with a blast of void energy that sent her flying.

"NO!" Kaelen's scream was primal fury. The awakening power surged, beyond his control now, fueled by rage and fear.

He became lightning.

Demons between him and Malakor simply died—too fast to react, too slow to defend. His blades cut through void-corrupted flesh like they weren't even there. In seconds, he crossed the courtyard that should have taken minutes.

Malakor turned to face him, intrigued. "The student. How delightful. Did Aric teach you that trick before I killed him?"

Kaelen attacked with everything—technique, power, rage, desperation. His silver-coated blades struck from impossible angles, moving faster than Malakor had clearly expected.

He actually drove her back three steps.

Then she got serious.

Her counter-strike would have killed him if Drakon hadn't interposed his massive draconic bulk, taking the shadow blade hit meant for Kaelen. The dragon prince roared in pain, void energy burning through scales.

"GET ELFIRIA OUT!" Drakon bellowed. "I WILL HOLD HERE!"

Kaelen made the choice in a heartbeat. He sprinted to where Elfiria lay stunned, scooped her into his arms, and ran.

Behind him, Drakon fought Malakor with the fury of an enraged dragon—claws against shadow blade, fire breath against void energy. He couldn't win, but he could buy time.

Alliance reinforcements arrived, flooding the courtyard. Mages hit Malakor with coordinated attacks. The weight of numbers began to tell.

Malakor laughed, genuinely delighted. "This was fun! We should do it again soon!"

Then she retreated, demons following, leaving destruction and casualties behind.

Drakon collapsed once she was gone, void burns covering his scaled hide. Healers rushed forward but the wounds were beyond their abilities—void corruption was slowly killing him.

"Need... fire..." Drakon gasped. "Draconic healing... requires heat..."

They built massive bonfires. Drakon lay in the center of the flames, his natural heat resistance letting him absorb the thermal energy. Slowly, painfully, the void corruption began to burn away.

"Is very unpleasant," he said weakly. "But is working. Will be fine. Eventually."

Elfiria was also wounded but less severely—exhaustion more than actual damage. She'd pushed herself too hard using the Holy Dome in combat.

Kaelen sat beside her in the healing tent as she recovered.

"I thought I lost you," he said quietly.

"I'm harder to kill than I look."

"You look like a strong wind would knock you over right now."

"Then it's good we're indoors." She squeezed his hand weakly. "Thank you. For choosing to save me instead of fighting Malakor."

"Always. Every time. I'll always choose you."

"Even if it means letting her escape?"

"Even then."

She pulled him down into a kiss—gentle, grateful, full of emotion too complicated to name.

When she finally released him, she whispered: "I love you, Kaelen. I know it's crazy and inappropriate and possibly the worst timing ever, but I do."

"I love you too. And the timing is perfect because we might die tomorrow, so at least we'll die knowing."

"You're very romantic for a cynical mercenary."

"Love makes me poetic apparently."

---

The siege continued for another week. More assaults, more casualties, supplies dwindling faster than planned. The refugee influx had stretched resources thin—they had maybe two weeks of food left at current consumption.

The council met daily, arguments growing more heated. Some members wanted to expel the refugees to conserve supplies. Others wanted to attempt a breakout, flee to other Alliance capitals.

Elfiria refused both options.

"We keep everyone fed, even if it means short rations for all," she declared. "And we hold these walls. Arcanis doesn't fall."

"Even if holding means starving?" someone challenged.

"Even then."

Kaelen watched her make these impossible decisions and loved her more each day. She bore the weight with grace, never complaining, never shirking responsibility.

But he could see the cost. She was using the Holy Dome more frequently—healing critically wounded, powering defensive wards, fighting off demon assaults. Each use aged her slightly, life force burning to fuel divine power.

"You're killing yourself," he told her one night.

"I'm spending myself wisely," she corrected. "There's a difference."

"Not from where I'm standing."

"Kaelen, we both know I won't survive this war. The Holy Dome demands too much. I've accepted that." She took his face in her hands. "What matters is what I do with the time I have left. I choose to protect people. All people, not just the politically convenient ones."

"That's what I'm afraid of. That you'll choose others over yourself until there's nothing left."

"Then love me while I'm here. Make what time we have matter."

They made love that night—desperate and tender, finding warmth in each other while the world burned outside. It wasn't their first time, but it felt different. More urgent. Like they both knew their time was running out faster than they wanted to admit.

Afterward, lying tangled together, Elfiria said: "I need to tell you something. About the Holy Dome's full activation."

Kaelen's stomach clenched. "What about it?"

"I can activate it completely—create an unbreakable barrier around the Alliance capitals, push the demons back, save everyone inside."

"That's... that's incredible. Why haven't you done it already?"

"Because the Dome's range is limited. I can cover maybe four kingdoms. Five if I burn out completely and die in the process." She paused. "Either way, the outer lands—Kharaz'Mar, anyone outside the barrier—they'd be abandoned to the demons."

"So you're choosing between saving some people or trying to save everyone and probably failing."

"Exactly."

Kaelen held her tighter. "What will you choose?"

"I don't know yet. But soon. The siege won't last much longer. We're running out of time and options." She looked at him. "What would you choose?"

"I'd choose you alive. Selfish, but true."

She smiled sadly. "That's why I love you. You're honest about your selfishness."

They fell asleep in each other's arms, knowing that soon—very soon—impossible choices would become unavoidable ones.

And when that time came, they'd face it together.

Or die trying.
