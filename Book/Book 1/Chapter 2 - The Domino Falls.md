# Book 1: The Dance of Life and Death
## Chapter 2: The Domino Falls

The Clearwater waystation lived up to its name in exactly one respect: it had a well with surprisingly clean water. Everything else about it was various shades of dubious, from the sagging roof of the main building to the questionable stew being served in the common room. Kaelen had stayed in worse places, but not many.

"At least the beds have fewer lice than usual," Horvath commented, settling down across from Kaelen with a bowl of the aforementioned questionable stew. "I'm counting that as a victory."

"You set a low bar for victories."

"You live longer that way." The merchant took a spoonful of stew, grimaced, but kept eating. Pragmatism in action. "That fight in the woods—you handled yourself better than expected."

"Thanks, I think."

"It's a compliment. Most sell-swords panic when enhanced fighters show up. You just... adapted. Where'd you learn to fight like that?"

Kaelen shrugged, not particularly wanting to discuss his past. "Here and there. You pick things up when survival depends on it."

Horvath studied him with those sharp merchant eyes that saw too much and understood more. "Fair enough. We'll reach Arcanis tomorrow afternoon if we make good time. I'll pay you then, plus a bonus for the excitement."

"Appreciated."

They ate in companionable silence after that. Across the room, Gorim was arm-wrestling one of the waystation's permanent residents—a scarred woman who looked like she ate nails for breakfast. Elise had retreated to her room early, probably still processing her first real combat. Rakken was nowhere to be seen, which was typical for rangers.

Kaelen finished his stew, which tasted like boot leather and regret, and headed upstairs to the small room he'd claimed. The bed was narrow but reasonably clean, and more importantly, the window offered a good view of the approach road. Old habits.

He lay down fully clothed, swords within reach, and stared at the ceiling. Tomorrow they'd reach Arcanis. He'd collect his pay, find another job, and continue the endless cycle of wandering and fighting and trying not to think too hard about what his life had become.

Except he couldn't stop thinking about those enhanced warriors. The shadow blade. The professional coordination. And the tavern gossip about war between Eldoria and Aridia spreading.

Something was wrong. Bigger than bandits. Bigger than border disputes.

But what was he supposed to do about it? He was one man with two swords and a talent for surviving. That didn't qualify him to solve geopolitical crises.

Sleep came eventually, fitful and populated with the usual nightmares. Burning villages and screaming faces and the eternal question: *Why did you survive when we all died?*

He never had a good answer.

---

They reached Oakhaven's outskirts the next morning, and Kaelen immediately knew something was catastrophically wrong.

Refugees. Hundreds of them, maybe thousands, streaming along the road toward the town. Men, women, children, all carrying whatever possessions they could salvage. Carts piled with furniture and family heirlooms. Livestock being driven in panicked herds. The classic signs of displacement.

"Gods above," Horvath breathed. "What happened?"

Gorim flagged down a passing man who looked slightly less desperate than the rest. "You there! What's going on?"

"War," the man said simply, eyes hollow with shock. "Full war. Aridia invaded Eldoria's southern provinces three days ago. Burned everything. My village... my home... all gone."

"Three days?" Elise said quietly. "But we left Oakhaven four days ago. That means—"

"It started right after we left," Kaelen finished. The timing made his instincts itch. That ambush in the woods. The enhanced warriors. Had they been delayed on purpose? Keep the valuable cargo from reaching Arcanis while the war started?

But why would whoever was pulling the strings care about magical components for the royal academy?

Unless those components were defensive in nature. Wards. Protective spells. Things that would help Eldoria survive a war.

"This is escalating too fast," Rakken said, appearing beside the wagon like a ghost made flesh. "Wars don't go from border skirmish to full invasion in days. Not without preparation. Not without planning."

Horvath's expression had gone from concerned to calculating. "Multiple kingdoms joining means there's coordination. And if there's coordination, there's profit to be made. Or losses to be cut." He glanced at his cargo. "I need to get these components to Arcanis yesterday. The academy's going to be desperate for anything that can bolster defenses."

They pushed on, the caravan forced to navigate around the flood of refugees. Oakhaven's gates were open, guards trying to maintain some semblance of order as displaced people poured in. The small border town was clearly not equipped to handle this influx.

Kaelen watched families stumble past, children crying, elderly being supported by younger relatives, and felt the old familiar anger building in his chest. This. This was what war did. Not glorious battles or heroic stands. Just ordinary people suffering because people in power made terrible decisions.

"We're not stopping?" Elise asked, looking at the refugees with obvious distress.

"Can't," Horvath said, though he didn't sound happy about it. "Oakhaven's going to be overwhelmed within hours. If we stop, we'll be trapped in the chaos. Better to push through to Arcanis."

It was pragmatic. It was logical. It was probably even the right decision.

Kaelen hated it anyway.

They made it through Oakhaven and back onto the main road toward Arcanis, leaving the refugee crisis behind them. But Kaelen couldn't shake the images. Couldn't unhear the sounds of children crying for lost homes.

"You're brooding," Gorim observed, walking beside him at the rear wagon.

"I'm thinking."

"Same thing for humans. You lot always look like you've bitten into a lemon when you think." The dwarf hefted his spear. "Can't help everyone. That's the way of the world."

"Doesn't mean I have to like it."

"No," Gorim agreed. "Just means you're not dead inside yet. Count your blessings."

They traveled through the afternoon, making better time now that they were past the refugee surge. The road to Arcanis was wider here, better maintained, with way stations and guard posts every few miles. Signs of civilization.

As evening approached, Horvath called a halt at one of the larger way stations—a fortified compound with actual walls and guards. Smart, given current events.

Kaelen was helping to secure the wagons when he heard the commotion at the gates.

More refugees, but these were different. Organized. Armed. A caravan of civilians with a defensive perimeter of fighters protecting them. Maybe fifty people total, moving with the discipline of those who knew danger was at their heels.

And riding at the front, mounted on a gray mare and carrying a bow that looked like it could punch through castle walls, was a woman with green hair.

Kaelen blinked. Green hair. Actually green, the color of spring leaves, done up in a long braid that fell past her shoulders. Elven, obviously. Tall and athletic, wearing practical leather armor that had seen use, with a quiver of arrows across her back and a confident set to her shoulders that suggested she knew exactly how dangerous she was.

She was also, objectively, beautiful. Not the soft beauty of nobility, but the sharp beauty of drawn steel—something to admire right up until it killed you.

The elf woman dismounted in one fluid motion, exchanged words with the way station guards, and started organizing her people. Kaelen found himself watching despite knowing he should probably get back to work.

"See something you like?" Rakken asked, appearing beside him with that unnerving ranger stealth.

"Just observing. Who brings fifty civilians through hostile territory without getting slaughtered?"

"Someone very good at her job." Rakken nodded toward the elf. "That's Lyra. Out of Sylvanaria, if the hair didn't give it away. She's been running refugee escorts for the past two weeks. Got a reputation for getting people out alive."

"Sylvanaria's not even in this war yet."

"No, but Sylvanian elves don't much care for borders. Some of them believe in helping, regardless of politics." Rakken smiled faintly. "Radical concept, I know."

Kaelen filed that information away and returned to securing the wagons. Not his business. The elf—Lyra—would do her thing, he'd do his, and their paths wouldn't cross.

Naturally, the universe immediately proved him wrong.

"You there! Dual-sword user!"

Kaelen turned to find Lyra walking toward him with the confident stride of someone used to being obeyed. Up close, he could see her eyes were emerald green, bright with intelligence and something that might have been humor.

"Can I help you?" he asked, keeping his tone neutral.

"Maybe. I need information. You came from Oakhaven direction, yes? What's the situation there?"

"Overwhelmed. Thousands of refugees flooding in. Town's not equipped to handle them."

Lyra swore creatively in Elvish, which Kaelen understood enough of to appreciate the metaphor involving a donkey and anatomically questionable positions.

"That bad?" he observed.

"Worse. I've got three more groups coming up behind me, another hundred people total. If Oakhaven's already saturated..." She trailed off, thinking. "Arcanis. I'll have to push for Arcanis."

"You're going to escort a hundred-fifty refugees to the capital. Through territory where enhanced warriors are ambushing caravans."

"Do you have a better suggestion?" The question was sharp, challenging.

Kaelen considered. "Join up with us. Horvath's got a caravan heading to Arcanis, and we've already proved we can handle enhanced fighters. More guards means better protection for everyone."

"And what does Horvath get out of this?"

"Goodwill, karma, and the warm fuzzy feeling of helping people?" At Lyra's skeptical look, Kaelen smiled slightly. "Also, fifty armed refugees who can help defend if we get attacked again. That's valuable."

"Pragmatic. I like it." Lyra extended her hand. "Lyra of Sylvanaria. Professional do-gooder and generally terrible influence."

Kaelen shook it, noting the calluses from bow work. "Kaelen. Professional survivor and occasionally useful with sharp objects."

"Modest too. Your parents must be so proud."

"They're dead, so hard to say."

The words came out flat, automatic. Lyra's expression shifted to something gentler, which Kaelen immediately distrusted. He didn't need pity.

"Sorry," she said, and sounded like she meant it. "That was tactless."

"It was seven years ago. I'm over it."

"No, you're not. But you've gotten good at pretending." Before Kaelen could respond to that uncomfortable observation, she continued, "I'll talk to your merchant friend. If he agrees to combined convoy, I've got supplies to contribute and fighters who know which end of a sword is pointy."

"He'll agree. Horvath's pragmatic above all else."

Lyra nodded and headed off to find the merchant. Kaelen watched her go, then forcibly stopped watching her go because he had work to do and no time for distractions.

Even if the distraction had green hair and eyes that saw too much.

---

As predicted, Horvath agreed immediately. The combined caravan would provide better protection, and the refugees came with supplies that could be shared. Win-win, as long as they didn't run into something too nasty.

They spent the night at the way station, which was crowded but defensible. Kaelen ended up sharing watch with Lyra, which he suspected was her intentional maneuvering but couldn't prove.

"So," she said, perched on the compound wall with her bow across her knees, "you're a mercenary with a death wish and trust issues. Am I close?"

"I'm a mercenary with rent issues and food issues. The death wish is incidental."

"Uh-huh. And the trust issues?"

"Those are well-earned, thank you."

She laughed, the sound surprisingly genuine. "Fair enough. I've got a rebellious streak and abandonment issues, so we're all damaged here."

"Rebellious streak?"

"Left Sylvanaria against the Matriarch's wishes. Elves are supposed to stay in their forests, not get involved in lesser races' problems." Her tone made it clear what she thought of that policy. "I disagreed. Loudly. With property damage."

Despite himself, Kaelen was curious. "What kind of property damage?"

"The ancient and irreplaceable kind." Lyra's grin was wicked. "They'll forgive me eventually. Probably. In a few centuries."

"Centuries?"

"Elven lifespan. We hold grudges longer than humans have kingdoms."

They lapsed into comfortable silence after that, watching the darkness beyond the walls. The spring night was cool, stars bright overhead in the absence of clouds. Peaceful, if you ignored the hundreds of displaced refugees sleeping in the courtyard and the looming specter of war.

"Why do you do this?" Kaelen asked after a while. "The escort work. Helping refugees. You could be safe in Sylvanaria, but instead you're here, risking your life for strangers."

Lyra was quiet for a long moment. "Because someone has to. And because if I didn't, I'd have to live with knowing I could have made a difference but chose comfort instead." She glanced at him. "Why do you take jobs protecting caravans when you could probably make more as a bandit?"

"Because I'm not a complete bastard?"

"Low bar, but I'll accept it."

Something screamed in the distance. Both of them were on their feet instantly, weapons drawn, scanning for threats.

"That came from the east," Lyra said, bow strung and arrow nocked faster than Kaelen could track.

"Raiders maybe. Or worse."

"Always worse lately."

They raised the alarm. Within minutes, the entire compound was awake and armed. Horvath, Gorim, Rakken, and Elise joined them on the walls. The refugee fighters took positions with practiced efficiency.

"Lights," Gorim ordered. "I want to see what we're dealing with."

Torches flared along the walls, pushing back the darkness. And in that light, they saw what was approaching.

Another refugee column, maybe twenty people, running for their lives. And behind them, riding them down like wolves after sheep, came raiders.

Not enhanced warriors this time. Just ordinary human raiders—which somehow made them worse. Enhanced fighters had an excuse of being corrupted or coerced. These were just people choosing to prey on the displaced and desperate.

"Open the gates!" Lyra commanded. "Get those refugees inside!"

"We open the gates, raiders might follow," one of the guards protested.

"Then we kill the raiders. Gates. Now."

Her tone brooked no argument. The gates swung open, and the fleeing refugees sprinted through. The raiders came after them—fifteen mounted killers whooping and hollering like this was sport.

It stopped being sport when Lyra's arrow took the lead raider through the eye.

"Welcome to my territory," she said pleasantly, already nocking another arrow. "Admission price is your life."

Chaos erupted. The raiders, realizing they'd charged into a defended position, tried to retreat. Lyra made that difficult by dropping three more in quick succession. Kaelen watched her work with professional appreciation—each shot was perfect, no wasted motion, arrows finding gaps in armor with uncanny precision.

The remaining raiders scattered into the darkness, leaving their dead behind.

The refugees stumbled through the gates, gasping and traumatized. Among them, Kaelen noticed a young woman cradling a baby, both covered in road dust. An old man with a priest's robes, murmuring prayers. A boy no older than ten, carrying a sword too big for him.

The cost of war in three snapshots.

"Get them water and blankets," Lyra ordered, already moving to help. "Check for injuries. And someone close those damn gates before the raiders grow a spine and try again."

The next hour was controlled chaos as they sorted out the new arrivals, treated minor wounds, and reinforced the defenses. Kaelen found himself working alongside Lyra, which kept happening with suspicious frequency.

"You're good with a bow," he commented while helping to distribute supplies.

"You're good at stating the obvious."

"I meant exceptionally good. That's Sniper-level accuracy."

Lyra smiled, pleased. "You know your job classifications. Yeah, I made Sniper two years ago. Working toward Hawkeye, but that requires a certification trial I haven't had time for." She hefted her bow. "This beauty's a Longbow of Seeking. Minor enchantment, helps with aiming at extreme range."

"Expensive."

"I'm very good at what I do. It pays well."

"And yet you're using those skills to escort refugees for probably minimal compensation."

"I contain multitudes." Lyra handed a waterskin to an elderly refugee, speaking gently in Eldorian common. Then to Kaelen: "Besides, what's the point of being good at something if you don't use it for something worthwhile?"

Kaelen didn't have a good answer to that. His skills were for survival, not altruism. But watching Lyra move among the refugees, offering comfort and competence in equal measure, he found himself wondering if maybe there was a different way to live.

Not that he'd actually change anything. But wondering was allowed.

By the time order was restored, dawn was approaching. The way station was now seriously overcrowded, with nearly a hundred refugees crammed into spaces meant for maybe thirty travelers.

"We need to move out early," Horvath said, gathering his guards and Lyra. "Get to Arcanis before the situation gets worse."

"Worse than war and raiders?" Elise asked weakly.

"Always assume it can get worse," Gorim advised. "Then you're pleasantly surprised when it merely gets terrible."

"That's the most depressing wisdom I've ever heard," Lyra observed.

"I'm a dwarf. We specialize in depressing wisdom."

They broke camp as the sun rose, the combined caravan now a small army of civilians, wagons, and determined fighters. Lyra had taken to riding near the front with Gorim, occasionally dropping back to check on the rear where Kaelen maintained his position.

"You don't have to keep checking on me," Kaelen said the third time she materialized beside him.

"Who says I'm checking on you? Maybe I just enjoy the view from the rear."

"The view being miles of empty road?"

"I'm easily entertained."

Despite his better judgment, Kaelen found himself smiling. There was something almost aggressively cheerful about Lyra that defied the grimness of their situation. It should have been annoying. Somehow it wasn't.

"Question," she said after they'd traveled in silence for a bit. "Why do you walk instead of ride? Everyone else with mounts is using them."

"I like having my feet on the ground. Horses are great until someone shoots them out from under you."

"Dark."

"Practical."

"Also dark."

They crested a hill, and Arcanis came into view in the distance. The City of Light, capital of Eldoria, gleaming white stone and soaring towers. Beautiful even from miles away.

Also burning.

Not the whole city—just sections near the walls. But smoke rose in black pillars, and even at this distance they could see chaos at the gates.

"Oh, that's not good," Lyra said quietly.

"Master of understatement over here."

"We should—"

The ground exploded twenty feet ahead of them.

Kaelen had his swords out before the debris finished falling. Beside him, Lyra's bow was already drawn, scanning for threats.

What emerged from the crater wasn't raiders or enhanced warriors.

It was a demon.

Seven feet tall, skin like burned leather, eyes glowing red with malevolent intelligence. Horns curled from its skull, and claws like kitchen knives extended from too-long fingers. It looked at the caravan and smiled, revealing teeth that belonged in nightmares.

"Well," the demon said in a voice like grinding stone, "isn't this convenient. A whole flock of sheep delivered right to me."

More craters erupted along the road. More demons. Five, ten, fifteen of them, surrounding the caravan in a perfect ambush formation.

"DEFENSIVE POSITIONS!" Gorim roared. "PROTECT THE CIVILIANS!"

The caravan collapsed into a defensive circle with the efficiency of people who'd been expecting disaster. Fighters to the outside, civilians in the center, wagons providing cover.

Kaelen found himself shoulder to shoulder with Lyra, both of them facing down three demons who looked very pleased with themselves.

"So," Lyra said conversationally, "this is new."

"You've never fought demons before?"

"Demons haven't existed in Mythosia for three hundred years. They're literally from myth."

"Well, they're back. And they look hungry."

"Starving, actually," one of the demons corrected cheerfully. "Been locked away for so long. So very hungry."

It attacked.

Kaelen met it with both swords, steel biting into demonic flesh that was tougher than normal meat. The demon laughed and swung claws that would have disemboweled him if he hadn't ducked.

An arrow took the demon in the throat. It staggered but didn't fall—these things were durable. Another arrow, this one punching through its eye. It screamed and went down thrashing.

"Thanks!" Kaelen yelled.

"Don't mention it! Little busy!" Lyra was already engaging the second demon, using her bow like a staff to deflect claws while backpedaling for distance.

Kaelen killed the downed demon with a strike through its heart—or where its heart should be. Hard to tell with demons. Then he turned to help Lyra.

The third demon blocked his path, grinning. "Hello, little swordsman. Want to dance?"

"Not particularly, but I'll make an exception."

They fought. The demon was fast, strong, and vicious. Kaelen was faster. His blades wove patterns, drawing black blood from a dozen cuts. The demon kept coming, seeming to feel no pain.

Elsewhere, the caravan fought for survival. Gorim's spear punched through demonic skulls. Elise hurled fire that made demons scream. Rakken put arrows through inhuman eyes with mechanical precision.

And Lyra—Lyra was a revelation. She moved like water, bow and arrows finding targets with impossible speed. Three demons fell to her shots in as many seconds.

Kaelen's opponent lunged. He sidestepped, brought both swords down in an X-pattern, and removed the demon's head.

It died with a laugh.

The battle raged for minutes that felt like hours. Demons fell, but so did defenders. Kaelen saw refugees go down screaming. Saw brave men and women die protecting strangers.

Finally, blessedly, the last demon fell.

Silence crashed down like a physical force.

Kaelen stood gasping, covered in black demon blood that steamed and stank. Around him, the survivors did the same. They'd won, but the cost was written in the bodies scattered across the road.

Fifteen dead. Twice that many wounded.

"Demons," Horvath said into the silence. "Actual demons. I thought those were extinct."

"So did everyone," Lyra replied, already moving to tend the wounded. Her hands shook slightly, the first sign of fear Kaelen had seen from her.

"If demons are back," Elise said quietly, "what brought them? What... what's happening?"

No one had an answer.

Kaelen looked toward Arcanis, still burning in the distance, and felt cold certainty settle in his chest.

This wasn't just war between kingdoms.

This was something much, much worse.

And they were walking right into it.

"Let's move," he said. "We need to reach the city. Get answers. Maybe find out how to kill whatever's causing this."

"Or die trying," Gorim added helpfully.

"Always an optimist."

They gathered their wounded, honored their dead with hasty prayers, and resumed the journey. Faster now, urgency overriding caution.

Kaelen walked beside Lyra again, both of them silent.

"Hey," she said after a mile. "We're probably going to die, right?"

"Probably."

"Want to make a pact? If I die first, you make sure it was for something that mattered. And vice versa."

Kaelen glanced at her. The green-haired elf with too much optimism and not enough self-preservation. Who saved refugees because someone had to. Who fought demons with a smile and a quiver of arrows.

"Deal," he said.

They shook on it, and Kaelen wondered if this was what having friends felt like.

He'd forgotten, in seven years of solitude.

It wasn't entirely unpleasant.

Ahead, Arcanis waited, burning and besieged.

Behind them, the dead cooled and the demons' laughter echoed in memory.

And somewhere, unseen and unfathomable, forces were moving that would reshape Mythosia forever.

The dominoes were falling.

And Kaelen, mercenary and survivor and accidental friend, could only walk forward into the chaos and hope his swords would be enough.

They'd have to be.

Because the alternative was extinction.
