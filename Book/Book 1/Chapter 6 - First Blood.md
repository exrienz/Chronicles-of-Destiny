# Book 1: The Dance of Life and Death
## Chapter 6: First Blood

Dawn came to the Valley of Kings like a executioner—cold, inevitable, and carrying the promise of death.

Kaelen stood at his position on the right flank, watching the eastern horizon lighten from black to gray to the sickly yellow-green that preceded sunrise. Around him, fifteen thousand Alliance soldiers stood in formation, weapons ready, prayers whispered, last wills mentally composed.

"You know what I hate about mornings?" Lyra said beside him, stringing her bow with practiced efficiency. "The way they insist on happening regardless of whether you're ready for them."

"Philosophical," Kaelen observed, checking his swords for the hundredth time. Sharp. Balanced. Ready to kill or be killed.

"I get philosophical when I'm terrified. It's either that or vomit, and I'm trying to maintain my dignity."

"How's that working out?"

"Ask me after the battle. If we're alive, it worked. If we're dead, the point is moot."

Drakon stomped over, fully armored and radiating barely contained excitement. The dragon prince's eyes literally glowed red in the pre-dawn gloom, and his tail swished back and forth like an overexcited dog.

"Good morning, battle-siblings!" he boomed. "Today is excellent day for glorious combat against forces of darkness, yes?"

"It's five in the morning," Lyra said. "Nothing is excellent at five in the morning."

"Your species is weak and requires excessive sleep! This is known!" Drakon's grin showed too many teeth. "I have not slept in three days! I am very ready for violence!"

Kaelen exchanged a look with Lyra. "Should we be concerned that our teammate is running on pure adrenaline and draconic enthusiasm?"

"I feel like that ship sailed when we befriended a seven-foot dragon prince who thinks 'subtle' is a type of food."

"I heard that!" Drakon declared. "Subtle is not food! Is abstract concept meaning... meaning..." He paused, considering. "Actually, what does subtle mean?"

"Not you," Kaelen and Lyra said in unison.

Further conversation was interrupted by a horn blast from the command position. Aric's signal. The Sword Saint stood on a raised platform where everyone could see him, a figure of calm competence in the growing chaos of pre-battle tension.

"ALLIANCE!" His magically amplified voice carried across the valley. "Scouts report the demon army is ten minutes out. Take your positions. Remember your training. Watch your flanks. And when they come—and they will come like a tide of darkness—you hold the line. You are not prey. You are warriors of Mythosia. Make. Them. Bleed."

A roar went up from fifteen thousand throats. Kaelen added his voice to it, feeling the collective determination washing away individual fear. This was it. No more training. No more preparation.

Real battle. Real demons. Real consequences.

"Vanguard, to me!" Aric called.

Kaelen jogged over with Lyra and Drakon, joining the other elite fighters. The Sword Saint surveyed his suicide squad with those gray eyes that saw too much.

"You're positioned on the right flank with the shock troops," he said without preamble. "When the demons hit, they'll try to envelope us. Your job is to prevent that. Kill anything that tries to get around our lines. If things get bad—and they will get bad—you hold until I send the signal to fall back to secondary positions."

"And if the signal doesn't come?" asked Gorim, hefting his spear.

"Then I'm dead, and you should run very fast in the opposite direction." Aric's expression might have been amused. Hard to tell. "Questions?"

"How will we know when things are 'bad' versus regular bad?" Lyra asked.

"When I personally show up to bail you out, things are bad. If multiple Demon Generals appear, things are catastrophically bad, and you retreat immediately. Clear?"

Various acknowledgments.

"Good. Take your positions. And Kaelen—" Aric caught his eye. "Remember what I taught you about the awakening. Don't force it. Let it flow when needed."

Kaelen nodded, not trusting his voice. The Sword Saint had been drilling him on channeling the latent power that had flickered during training. Control it or it would consume him, Aric had warned. Power without discipline was just slow suicide.

They returned to their positions. The right flank shock troops—hardened veterans from all five kingdoms—made room for the Vanguard without comment. Kaelen noticed some of them touching good luck charms, others praying to various gods, still others simply checking weapons with grim determination.

Different faiths, different backgrounds, all united in the certainty that they might die today.

"Can I tell you something?" Lyra said quietly.

"Sure."

"I'm absolutely terrified."

Kaelen glanced at her. The usually irreverent elf looked small in her armor, bow gripped white-knuckled, emerald eyes wide with fear she was trying hard to hide.

"Me too," he admitted.

"Really? You seem so calm."

"I've had seven years to get good at pretending I'm not about to die. You get used to it."

"That's the most depressing thing you've ever said, and you say depressing things constantly."

"It's a gift."

Drakon leaned over, his massive presence somehow comforting. "Fear is good! Means you are not stupid! Stupid people die first in battle because they think they are invincible! Smart people who are afraid fight better!"

"That's actually wise," Lyra said, surprised.

"I contain multitudes! Also my father told me this before sending me to mortal realm. He was very insistent about not dying stupidly."

"Your father sounds smart."

"He is ancient dragon of great wisdom! Also he breathes fire and eats people who annoy him, so being smart around him is survival strategy."

The eastern horizon erupted in darkness.

Not metaphorical darkness—actual darkness, like someone had spilled ink across the sky. The sickly dawn light strangled and died, replaced by an unnatural gloom that made every torch and mage-light suddenly seem inadequate.

"Here they come," someone whispered.

The demon army appeared like a stain spreading across the land. Thousands of them—no, tens of thousands. Humanoid demons with claws and fangs, quadrupedal beasts the size of horses, aerial demons on leathery wings, and massive creatures that defied easy categorization.

They moved in organized formations. Not a mindless horde but an actual army, with discipline and tactical coherence.

Somehow that made it worse.

"So many," Lyra breathed.

"Fifteen thousand of us, maybe thirty thousand of them," Kaelen estimated. "Bad odds."

"Excellent odds!" Drakon countered. "We are outnumbered only two to one! This is fair fight!"

"Your definition of 'fair' needs work."

The demon army stopped just outside archer range, a sea of claws and malice waiting for the signal to attack. Kaelen could feel the hatred radiating from them—void-spawned creatures that existed to unmake creation itself.

In the terrible silence, a single demon stepped forward. Eight feet tall, corded with inhuman muscle, wearing armor made of what looked like fused bone. It raised a sword—if you could call a six-foot cleaver a sword—and pointed it at the Alliance lines.

Then it laughed.

The sound echoed across the valley, bouncing off hills, magnified by void magic until it felt like reality itself was laughing at them.

"ALLIANCE OF LIGHT!" the demon roared in perfect common tongue. "THE DEMON KING SENDS HIS REGARDS! YOU WILL BREAK! YOU WILL FLEE! AND WE WILL FEAST ON YOUR DESPAIR!"

"ALLIANCE!" Aric's voice cut through the demon's mockery like a blade. "SHOW THEM WHAT WE THINK OF THEIR THREATS!"

Fifteen thousand warriors responded with a defiant roar that made the ground shake.

The demon's smile faltered.

Then it raised its cleaver-sword and screamed: "ATTACK!"

The demon army charged.

"ARCHERS!" the Alliance commander bellowed. "LOOSE!"

The sky went dark with arrows. Thousands of projectiles arcing up and then down, a lethal rain descending on the demon front ranks. Demons fell screaming, arrows punching through void-corrupted flesh. Lyra's bow sang beside Kaelen, each shot precisely aimed, each finding a target.

But the demons kept coming.

The second volley launched. More demons fell. Not enough.

Third volley. Fourth. The bodies piled up, creating obstacles the living had to climb over.

Still they came.

"BRACE!" the commander ordered.

Kaelen set his feet, swords drawn, and waited for impact.

The demon army hit the Alliance lines like a tsunami of claws and hatred.

The world became blood and screaming and the ring of steel on claw. Kaelen's training took over, his body moving before his mind caught up. Parry left claw, riposte with right sword, duck under chomping jaws, pivot and strike upward into exposed throat.

First demon down. Blood—black and steaming—splattered across his armor.

No time to think. Two more demons charging. Kaelen's blades wove patterns Aric had drilled into him. High-low combination, feint right, strike left. The first demon took a sword through the eye socket. The second lost its head to a spinning slash.

Around him, the Alliance line held. Barely. Shock troops fought with desperate efficiency, spears punching through demonic flesh, shields deflecting claws, battle cries mixing with death screams.

Lyra had switched to a longer knife for close quarters, using her bow as a staff to keep demons at distance while placing perfect strikes to vital points. An aerial demon dove at her; she spun, bow coming up, and somehow managed to shoot it point-blank through the throat.

"LITTLE BUSY HERE!" she shouted, stabbing a demon trying to flank her.

Drakon had apparently decided that fighting in humanoid form was for people without draconic heritage. His transformation was partial—maintaining human size but sprouting scales, claws extending, strength multiplying. He grabbed a demon by the head with each hand and smashed them together hard enough that the crack was audible over the battle din.

"THIS IS EXCELLENT!" he roared with joy. "I WISH TO FIGHT MANY MORE DEMONS!"

"CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR!" Kaelen yelled back, cutting down another attacker.

As if on cue, the demon lines parted, and something big pushed through.

A demon champion. Ten feet of armored malice, wielding a warhammer that looked like it had been forged from tortured souls. It spotted the Vanguard and smiled.

"Oh, that's not good," Lyra observed with impressive understatement.

The champion charged. Regular demons scattered to give it room. It brought the warhammer down in an overhead strike that would have cratered the ground—

Except Kaelen wasn't there anymore.

His body moved on instinct honed by Aric's training. Sidestep, close distance, strike at knee joint. His blade bit into the champion's leg, drawing black blood. Not a killing blow, but it stumbled.

Lyra's arrow took it in the throat.

Drakon's clawed fist punched through its chest plate.

The champion fell, and the regular demons hesitated, uncertainty flashing across inhuman faces.

"PUSH!" Gorim bellowed from somewhere to the left. "WHILE THEY'RE SCARED! PUSH!"

The Alliance line surged forward. Demons gave ground, then rallied, then gave ground again. Kaelen fought in the press of bodies, his swords finding targets with mechanical efficiency. Kill, move, kill again. No thought, just reaction and training.

Hours passed. Or maybe minutes. Time became meaningless in combat, measured only in heartbeats and near-death experiences.

The demons began to retreat.

Not a rout—an organized withdrawal, pulling back to reform lines. The Alliance didn't pursue; they were too exhausted, too bloodied, too grateful for the reprieve.

Kaelen stood gasping, checking himself for wounds. Multiple cuts, nothing serious. Lyra was bleeding from a gash on her arm but still standing. Drakon looked like he'd bathed in demon blood and enjoyed it.

"Is... is it over?" someone asked.

"First wave," Aric's voice carried across the battlefield. The Sword Saint appeared, walking along the lines, his white robes somehow still pristine despite the carnage. "They're testing us. Seeing how we fight, what our tactics are. The real assault comes next."

"That wasn't the real assault?" Lyra sounded faint.

"That was the warm-up." Aric stopped in front of the Vanguard. "You did well. Held the line, killed the champion, maintained discipline. But conserve your strength. When they come back, it'll be worse."

He moved on, offering words of encouragement to other units. Kaelen slumped against a shield wall, drinking from his waterskin with shaking hands.

"We survived," he said, more to himself than anyone else.

"First battle of the war," Lyra replied, sitting heavily beside him. "We'll have scars to prove it."

"I collect scars," Drakon announced proudly, showing off the claw marks on his scaled arms. "Each one is story! This one is from demon who thought he could bite dragon! He learned error of thinking very quickly when I ate him!"

"You ate a demon?" Lyra looked horrified.

"Only small bite. Was not tasty. Too much void corruption, not enough meat. Would not recommend."

Despite everything—the death, the exhaustion, the certainty of more fighting to come—Kaelen found himself laughing. Drakon's complete lack of filter in the face of apocalyptic warfare was somehow exactly what he needed.

Movement across the valley caught his attention. The demon army was reorganizing, fresh troops moving up. And behind them, on a hill overlooking the battlefield, several figures stood watching.

Tall figures. Radiating power that made the regular demons look like insects.

"Demon Generals," Kaelen said quietly.

Lyra followed his gaze and swore creatively in Elvish. "They're just watching. Observing."

"Learning," Kaelen corrected. "Seeing how we fight so they can counter it later."

"Cheerful thought."

But before the demons could launch their second assault, something changed.

Divine light erupted from the Alliance command section. Pure, clean radiance that pushed back the unnatural darkness the demons had brought. Kaelen felt warmth wash over him, soothing aches, closing minor wounds, restoring strength.

Elfiria.

The High Priestess stood on the command platform, the Holy Dome artifact glowing in her hands. She was radiant—silver hair streaming in a divine wind, golden eyes blazing with power, white robes billowing around her like wings.

She looked like an angel come to war.

"WARRIORS OF THE ALLIANCE!" her voice rang out, amplified by divine magic. "THE LIGHT STANDS WITH YOU! THE VOID MAY HUNGER, BUT WE WILL NOT YIELD! WE WILL NOT BREAK! WE ARE THE ALLIANCE OF LIGHT, AND WE. WILL. PREVAIL!"

The demon army recoiled from the radiance. Kaelen saw some of the lesser demons actually burning where the light touched them. The Generals on the hill looked annoyed but not frightened.

And Elfiria—she caught Kaelen's eye across the battlefield. For just a moment, the untouchable priestess-queen looked at the battered mercenary, and her expression said everything words couldn't.

*Stay alive. Please. Stay alive.*

He nodded. A promise.

Then the second wave hit, and thinking time was over.

This assault was coordinated, vicious, and overwhelming. Elite demons in actual armor, wielding weapons instead of just claws. Flying demons attacking from above. Massive beasts charging the line with battering ram force.

The Alliance buckled but held.

Kaelen found himself fighting three demons at once, his body moving faster than thought. The power Aric had helped him awaken flickered to life—silver energy coating his blades, his movements accelerating beyond normal human capability.

He was dancing now, truly dancing. The twin swords sang their song of death, and demons fell like wheat before a scythe. One. Two. Three. Five. Ten. He lost count, lost himself in the flow of combat, becoming an instrument of precision violence.

Lyra saw it. "Kaelen! Your swords!"

He didn't respond, couldn't respond. The power was intoxicating, flooding his veins with liquid lightning. He could kill anything. He was invincible. He was—

A demon's claw caught him across the ribs, penetrating his leather armor, drawing blood.

The pain snapped him back to reality. The silver energy flickered and died. Kaelen stumbled, suddenly human again, suddenly exhausted.

"TOO MUCH TOO FAST!" Drakon appeared, grabbing the demon that had wounded Kaelen and literally tearing it in half. "You are using power wrong! Aric said control, not flood!"

"I know," Kaelen gasped. "Lost control for a second."

"Do not lose it again or you will be dead!" The dragon prince tossed the demon corpse aside. "Also you are bleeding! This is not good for continued survival!"

Lyra was there, pressing cloth to his wound. "That's deep. You need a healer."

"After the battle."

"You'll bleed out before then!"

"Then I'll bleed out fighting!" Kaelen pushed her hand away, raising his swords. "We hold the line!"

The battle raged on. Kaelen fought more carefully now, conserving strength, using technique over power. The awakening lurked beneath his skin, tempting him, but he kept it locked down. Control. Discipline. Aric's teachings.

And then, finally, miraculously, the demon army retreated again.

This time it was real. They withdrew completely, pulling back across the valley, leaving the field to the Alliance. The demons were done testing.

They knew what they needed to know.

As the last demon disappeared from sight, a ragged cheer went up from the Alliance lines. They'd won. Held against impossible odds. Survived their first major engagement.

The cost was written in blood and bodies. Kaelen looked around and saw the casualties: hundreds dead, more than a thousand wounded. The field was a charnel house.

But they'd held.

Aric appeared among the troops, walking the line again, this time with pride evident in his bearing. "Well fought! All of you! You proved the demons can bleed! You proved we can stand against them!"

The cheering intensified.

But Kaelen wasn't cheering. He was watching the distant hill where the Demon Generals had observed the battle. They were leaving now, satisfied with whatever intelligence they'd gathered.

This had been a test.

The real war hadn't even started yet.

---

Evening found Kaelen in the healing tents, getting his ribs stitched by a priest with more enthusiasm than skill. It hurt like fire, but he'd had worse.

"You're lucky," the priest said cheerfully. "Quarter inch deeper and that claw would have punctured your lung. Then you'd be drowning in your own blood instead of just being in agonizing pain!"

"Your bedside manner needs work," Kaelen observed through gritted teeth.

"I've been stitching soldiers for six hours straight. Bedside manner is a luxury we can't afford." The priest tied off the last stitch. "There. Try not to get disemboweled in the next few days while that heals."

"I'll add it to my list of priorities."

Kaelen left the tent, holding his ribs carefully. The camp was a mix of celebration and mourning—soldiers drinking to survival while others wept over fallen comrades. The duality of war.

"There you are!" Lyra appeared from the gloom, looking exhausted but alive. "I've been looking everywhere. Drakon wanted to make sure you weren't dead."

"Just wounded. Where is our draconic friend?"

"Drinking with the Kharaz'Mar dwarves. Apparently they challenged him to a drinking contest, and he decided that getting catastrophically drunk after a life-or-death battle was 'traditional celebration ritual.'"

"He's going to regret that tomorrow."

"He's going to regret it in an hour. Dwarven spirits could strip paint." Lyra studied him with concern. "How bad are the ribs?"

"Stitched, painful, but not life-threatening. I'll live."

"Good. Because I have something to show you."

She led him through the camp to a quieter area, away from the celebrations and mourning. A small pavilion had been set up, and divine light glowed from within.

Elfiria's quarters.

Kaelen hesitated. "I don't think I should—"

"She asked for you specifically," Lyra said. "Something about thanking you for your service today." Her expression was unreadable. "Go. I'll make sure you're not disturbed."

Before Kaelen could respond, Lyra disappeared into the camp, leaving him alone outside the pavilion.

He took a breath, immediately regretted it as his ribs protested, and entered.

Elfiria sat on a simple camp chair, still wearing her ceremonial robes but looking exhausted. Using the Holy Dome clearly took its toll. When she saw Kaelen, her face lit up with genuine relief.

"You're alive," she said simply.

"Disappointed?"

"Shut up and sit down before you fall down."

Kaelen sat on the offered chair, acutely aware that he was filthy, blood-stained, and smelled like battlefield. She, by contrast, still radiated divine grace despite her exhaustion.

"I saw you fight," Elfiria said. "From the command platform. You were... magnificent. Moving like lightning, cutting through demons like they were nothing."

"I lost control. Nearly got killed for it."

"But you didn't. You adapted, survived, kept fighting." She leaned forward. "Kaelen, do you understand what you did today? You held the right flank. The demons tried to envelope us, and you stopped them. Hundreds of lives saved because you were there."

"We were there," Kaelen corrected. "Lyra, Drakon, the shock troops—it was everyone."

"Yes, but you led them. I watched you turn a defensive position into a killing ground. That's not just survival instinct—that's leadership."

Kaelen didn't know what to say to that. He was a mercenary. Mercenaries didn't lead; they followed contracts and tried not to die.

Except he'd volunteered for this. No contract. Just choice.

"I also saw you get wounded," Elfiria continued, her voice softer now. "Saw the demon's claw catch you. My heart stopped."

"I'm fine."

"You're hurt." She stood, moving closer. "May I?"

"May you what?"

"Heal you. Properly. Not field stitching that will leave ugly scars."

Before Kaelen could protest, her hands were on his chest, right over the wound. Divine light flowed from her fingers, warmth spreading through his ribs. The pain receded, replaced by a pleasant tingling as flesh knitted back together.

"There," Elfiria said, but her hands remained on his chest. "Better?"

Kaelen looked down at her. Up close, he could see the gold flecks in her eyes, the slight imperfections that made her real instead of some untouchable ideal. Her lips were parted slightly, close enough to kiss.

"Thank you," he managed.

"You're welcome."

Neither of them moved. The moment stretched, heavy with possibility.

"Kaelen," Elfiria whispered. "I know I'm a queen. I know I'm supposed to be above personal feelings. But when I saw you fighting today, risking everything, I realized—"

The tent flap burst open. A runner appeared, looking panicked.

"My lady! Emergency council! The scouts have returned with news!"

The moment shattered. Elfiria stepped back, composure sliding into place like a mask. "Of course. I'll be there immediately."

The runner left. Elfiria turned back to Kaelen, frustration clear in her expression.

"Duty calls," she said wryly.

"Always does."

"But Kaelen—what I was going to say—"

"I know." He stood carefully, testing his newly healed ribs. Perfect. "And for what it's worth, when I saw you standing there in divine light, I thought you were the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. Terrifying, but beautiful."

Elfiria smiled, and it transformed her face from regal to radiant. "We'll continue this conversation later. When the world isn't ending."

"It's a date."

"A date," she agreed. "Now go rest. Tomorrow might be worse than today."

"Comforting."

"I try."

Kaelen left her pavilion and returned to his own tent, mind spinning. He'd survived his first major battle. Awakened power he didn't fully understand. And nearly kissed a queen.

What a day.

Outside, he could hear Drakon singing something in Draconic that was probably obscene, backed by dwarven cheering. Lyra's laughter rang out, bright and genuine.

His friends. His... family?

Strange how that had happened.

Kaelen lay down on his bedroll, staring at the tent ceiling, and thought about divine light and starlight eyes and a future that might include something more than just survival.

Tomorrow the war would continue.

Tonight, he had hope.

It was enough.
