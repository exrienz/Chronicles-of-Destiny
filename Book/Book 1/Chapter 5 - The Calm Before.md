# Book 1: The Dance of Life and Death
## Chapter 5: The Calm Before

Aric's definition of "training" apparently involved trying to kill them in increasingly creative ways.

Kaelen hit the ground for the fifth time that morning, tasting blood and dirt in equal measure. Above him, the Sword Saint stood with his katana resting casually on his shoulder, looking like he'd been out for a pleasant stroll rather than dismantling eight fighters simultaneously.

"You're telegraphing through your hips," Aric observed. "Fix it, or the next demon you fight will gut you."

Kaelen climbed to his feet, spat blood, and raised his swords again. Beside him, Lyra was already back up, bow discarded in favor of a practice staff since Aric insisted everyone learn close-quarters combat. Drakon was sitting down—because he'd been knocked down so hard he'd created a crater—but grinning with manic enthusiasm.

"Again!" the draconic prince roared. "This is excellent education through violence!"

"The dragon's insane," Lyra muttered.

"But not wrong," Kaelen admitted. "I've learned more in two days than I did in three years of mercenary work."

"That's because you've been learning bad habits for three years," Aric said, having the superhuman hearing of all legendary warriors. "Now we're breaking them. Painfully. With extreme prejudice."

They attacked again. Kaelen focused on his footwork, trying to move from the hips without telegraphing. His blades came in from multiple angles—high, low, feint left, strike right. Complex combinations that should have overwhelmed most opponents.

Aric deflected every strike with minimal movement, his katana describing elegant arcs that made Kaelen's twin-blade style look like angry flailing.

Then the Sword Saint's blade stopped an inch from Kaelen's throat.

"Dead. Again. But better." Aric lowered his weapon. "You're adapting. Good. Adaptability keeps you alive when skill fails."

The praise felt like being knighted. Kaelen tried not to look too pleased and failed utterly based on Lyra's smirk.

"Break time!" Aric called. "Twenty minutes. Hydrate, reflect on your failures, try not to die of embarrassment."

The Vanguard trainees collapsed in various states of exhaustion. Kaelen claimed a spot under a tree, drinking from his waterskin and cataloging his new collection of bruises. Two weeks of this. He might actually be dead before they fought any demons.

"You did well," someone said.

Kaelen looked up to find Elfiria approaching, radiant in white robes that somehow remained pristine despite the dusty training ground. She'd been observing the morning session, along with various other Alliance leaders who had nothing better to do than watch the expendable elite get demolished.

"I got knocked down five times," Kaelen pointed out.

"By the greatest warrior in Mythosia. That's not failure—that's education." She sat beside him with unconscious grace. "May I?"

"It's a public tree."

Elfiria laughed softly and settled into a comfortable position, close enough that Kaelen could feel the warmth of her divine aura. It was... distracting.

"I wanted to apologize," she said after a moment.

"For what?"

"For involving you in this. The Vanguard is a death sentence dressed up as heroism. You volunteered, yes, but I can't help feeling responsible." Her golden eyes held genuine concern. "You barely know me, yet you're risking everything to help save my people, my kingdom."

"Our kingdom," Kaelen corrected. "Our world. This isn't just about Aetheria."

"No, but Aetheria is my burden specifically. The Holy Dome, the divine protection—it all falls on me." She looked at her hands. "Sometimes I wonder if I'm strong enough for what's coming."

It was the first time Kaelen had seen her vulnerability, the human beneath the divine vessel. It made her somehow more beautiful and infinitely more real.

"You're strong enough," he said. "I've seen you face down impossible situations with grace. If anyone can carry this burden, it's you."

"That's kind of you to say."

"It's true. Though I admit I don't have much basis for comparison. Most royalty I've met are useless in a crisis."

"High praise indeed." Elfiria's smile was genuine. "Tell me about yourself, Kaelen. All I know is that you're a mercenary who volunteers for suicide missions. There must be more to you than that."

"Not really. I'm pretty simple—pointy end goes in the enemy, avoid dying, collect pay."

"Somehow I doubt that." She shifted to face him more directly. "Where are you from?"

Kaelen hesitated. Talking about his past wasn't something he did. But Elfiria's gaze held that quality that made deception feel wrong, and he found himself answering honestly.

"Small village on Eldoria's western border. Name doesn't matter—it's gone now. Bandits burned it seven years ago. I was fifteen and out fetching water. By the time I got back..." He shrugged. "Everyone was dead. So I took my father's sword and left. Been wandering ever since."

"I'm sorry." Elfiria's hand found his, warm and real. "That's a terrible burden for anyone, especially someone so young."

"It was a long time ago."

"Pain doesn't diminish with time—we just get better at carrying it." She squeezed his hand gently. "Is that why you volunteer? To prevent others from losing what you lost?"

"Maybe. Or maybe I just got tired of running." Kaelen looked at their joined hands, at this moment of impossible intimacy with someone who should be completely beyond his reach. "What about you? You're a queen and a priestess. How does someone end up with both those burdens?"

"Accident of birth, mostly." Elfiria's expression turned wry. "I was born Aasimar—direct descendant of celestial beings. That comes with certain... expectations. Divine power, sacred duty, the whole package. My parents ruled Aetheria before me, and when they died, the responsibility passed to me."

"How old were you?"

"Seventeen. Old enough to wear the crown, young enough to have no idea what I was doing." She laughed softly. "I still don't, most days. I just try to project confidence and hope no one notices I'm making it up as I go."

"You hide it well."

"Years of practice. Royal bearing is ninety percent acting and ten percent not falling over in these ridiculous robes."

Kaelen found himself smiling. Talking with Elfiria was easy in a way he hadn't expected—beneath the divine radiance and royal bearing was someone funny and self-aware and surprisingly relatable.

"Can I ask you something potentially inappropriate?" he said.

"I reserve the right to smite you if it's too inappropriate, but yes."

"Why are you talking to me? I'm nobody—a mercenary with two swords and dubious life choices. You're royalty. Shouldn't you be networking with other important people?"

Elfiria was quiet for a moment, her thumb absently tracing patterns on his hand. "Because everyone else sees me as Queen Elfiria, vessel of divine light, untouchable symbol of hope. They put me on a pedestal and keep a respectful distance. But you..." She looked at him. "You see me as a person first. You argue with me, make jokes, treat me like I'm real. Do you know how rare that is?"

"I can imagine."

"Plus, you're interesting. Brave, self-aware enough to mock your own choices, and reasonably attractive despite the persistent bruises Aric keeps giving you."

Kaelen's brain temporarily short-circuited. "Reasonably attractive?"

"Don't let it go to your head. You're still a disaster."

"Noted."

They sat in comfortable silence after that, hands still joined, watching the other trainees recover from their morning of educational violence. Kaelen was intensely aware that this moment was probably insane—a mercenary and a queen, holding hands under a tree like normal people—but he couldn't bring himself to care.

"Kaelen!" Lyra's voice cut through the moment. "Break's over! Aric wants us for advanced footwork drills!"

Which was apparently Vanguard code for "more creative ways to hit the ground."

Elfiria released his hand with obvious reluctance. "Good luck. Try not to get concussed."

"No promises."

She left with grace and purpose, and Kaelen watched her go with the certainty that he was developing feelings that would absolutely get him killed.

"You've got it bad," Lyra observed, appearing beside him with her trademark terrible timing.

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"You're holding the hand she was holding. You're staring after her like she's made of starlight. You're—"

"Fine. Yes. I'm attracted to the literal angel-queen who is completely out of my league. Happy?"

"Ecstatic. This is the best entertainment I've had in years." Lyra's expression softened slightly. "For what it's worth, she likes you too. The way she looks at you when you're not watching—that's not just political courtesy."

"She's being kind. It's probably part of her job description."

"Keep telling yourself that, mercenary boy. Now come on—Aric's waiting, and you know how he gets when people are late."

They returned to training. The afternoon session focused on anti-demon tactics—fighting opponents who were faster, stronger, and didn't play by normal rules. Aric demonstrated techniques for targeting weak points, exploiting demonic regeneration limits, and generally surviving encounters that should kill you.

"Demons are arrogant," Aric explained while casually dismantling a training dummy with strikes too fast to follow. "They rely on supernatural advantages and assume we're helpless. Use that. Be unpredictable. Human creativity beats demonic power when applied correctly."

Drakon raised his hand. "Question! What if one is part dragon and therefore already superior to humans?"

"Then you fight like you're weak anyway, because arrogance gets you killed."

"This seems counterintuitive!"

"Yes. That's why it works."

Drakon considered this with the gravity of someone encountering philosophy for the first time, then nodded decisively. "I will pretend to be weak! This is cunning like... like fox!"

"Close enough," Aric muttered.

They drilled until sunset, until Kaelen's arms were numb and his legs threatened to give out. Then Aric called them together for final remarks.

"Tomorrow we leave for the Alliance base camp at Valley of Kings," the Sword Saint announced. "The main army is assembling there. Intelligence suggests demons are massing for a major assault—possibly trying to break the Alliance before we're fully prepared." He paused, gray eyes scanning each face. "This is real now. No more theoretical training. The next time we fight, people will die. Some of you might be among them."

Sobering thought. The Vanguard trainees exchanged glances, weight of reality settling on shoulders.

"But," Aric continued, "you're the best fighters the Alliance has. You've trained harder in two weeks than most soldiers train in years. When the battle comes, you'll be ready." He almost smiled. "And if you're not, you'll be dead, so you won't care."

"Inspirational!" Drakon declared. "I feel both motivated and concerned for my mortality!"

"That's the goal. Dismissed. Get some rest—tomorrow's a long march."

The Vanguard dispersed. Kaelen headed to the mess tent, where food of questionable providence but adequate calories awaited. He claimed a bowl of stew, found a relatively quiet corner, and tried not to think about the upcoming battle.

"Mind if we join?" Lyra appeared with Drakon in tow, both carrying their own meals.

"Free country. Well, free alliance of countries facing mutual extinction."

They settled in, eating in companionable silence for a few minutes.

"So," Drakon said eventually, "tomorrow we march to war! This is exciting!"

"The word you're looking for is 'terrifying,'" Lyra corrected.

"No, I am quite certain I mean exciting! Battle against worthy foes, chance for glory, possibility of death making life feel more alive!" The dragon-prince beamed. "What is not to love?"

"The dying part, mostly."

"Psh. Dying is easy. Living with cowardice is hard!"

Kaelen found himself smiling despite everything. Drakon's enthusiasm was infectious, even when discussing their probable demise. "You're a strange one, prince."

"This is compliment, yes?"

"Sure. Let's go with that."

They finished their meal, and Drakon launched into an enthusiastic retelling of his morning training, complete with dramatic reenactments using bread rolls as props. Lyra provided color commentary. Kaelen watched his unlikely companions and thought, These are my friends now.

When had that happened?

Later, as he lay in his tent trying to sleep, Kaelen reflected on how much his life had changed in two weeks. He'd gone from solitary mercenary to member of an elite squad, from cynic to someone with something worth fighting for.

Multiple somethings, actually.

The Alliance. His friends. And Elfiria, with her starlight eyes and vulnerability hidden behind divine radiance.

Yeah. He was definitely in trouble.

But tomorrow they'd march to war.

Tomorrow the dance would truly begin.

Tonight, he had a few more hours of peace.

Kaelen closed his eyes and tried to rest.

The demons would wait.

The world would keep turning.

And in the morning, he'd stand with heroes against the dark.

Strange how life worked out sometimes.

**VALLEY OF KINGS - ALLIANCE BASE CAMP**

The march to Valley of Kings took three days, and Kaelen spent most of it trying not to think about how many ways the upcoming battle could go wrong. It was a losing effort—his imagination was creative and his survival instinct was loud.

The Valley itself was a natural fortification, a wide depression surrounded by hills that provided defensive positions. The Alliance army had established camp there: thousands of soldiers from five kingdoms, organized into units that were still learning to work together.

It was chaos dressed up as military precision.

"Fifteen thousand soldiers," Lyra said, surveying the camp from a hilltop vantage. "Think it's enough?"

"Depends on how many demons show up." Kaelen watched supplies being sorted, defensive positions being fortified, commanders arguing about tactics. "We won't know until they attack."

"Comforting."

The Vanguard was assigned to the command section, close to where Aric and the Alliance leaders coordinated strategy. Kaelen helped set up their area, trying to look professional despite having no idea what he was doing.

That evening, Aric called an assembly for the entire army. Fifteen thousand soldiers gathered in the Valley's center as the sun set, a sea of faces illuminated by torches.

The Sword Saint stood on a raised platform, and his presence alone commanded attention.

"Soldiers of the Alliance!" His voice carried across the valley, magically amplified. "You come from five kingdoms. Different cultures, different traditions, different gods. Three weeks ago, you might have been enemies. Today, you stand together because you understand one simple truth: we fight as one, or we die alone."

Silence greeted his words.

"The demons come to consume our world. They feed on death, on despair, on the belief that we cannot win. I say we prove them wrong!" Aric's hand went to his katana. "Yes, we face impossible odds. Yes, many of us will fall. But we are not helpless prey—we are warriors of Mythosia! We have skill, courage, and the will to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves!"

A cheer started somewhere in the ranks, spreading like wildfire.

"Tomorrow, demons will come to this valley expecting easy victims. Instead, they'll find the Alliance of Light—ready, willing, and absolutely done with their extinction-level bullshit!"

The cheer became a roar. Fifteen thousand voices united in defiance.

Kaelen felt something shift in his chest—a warmth that had nothing to do with divine magic. Hope. The feeling he'd forgotten existed.

Beside him, Lyra was cheering. Drakon was roaring loud enough to qualify as a weapon. And when Kaelen glanced toward the command tent, he found Elfiria watching him with an expression that made his heart do complicated things.

She smiled.

He smiled back.

And in that moment, standing on the edge of battle with friends beside him and something like purpose filling his chest, Kaelen thought, Maybe we can actually win this.

It was probably delusional.

But delusion felt better than despair.

The army dispersed to prepare, energy and determination replacing the previous uncertainty.

Kaelen returned to his tent, checked his weapons for the hundredth time, and tried to get some sleep before the battle.

It didn't come easy.

But when it did, he dreamed not of burning villages, but of starlight eyes and a future where survival meant something more than just not dying.

It was a nice change.

Come morning, he'd face demons.

Tonight, he had hope.

It would have to be enough.
