# Book 1: The Dance of Life and Death
## Chapter 1: Ashes and Echoes

The ale tasted like regret, which was fitting. Everything in Oakhaven tasted like regret if you gave it enough thought—the water from the well, the stew at The Rusty Blade, even the women who occasionally graced Kaelen's bed. Not that he'd had much of that lately. Hard to maintain a healthy romantic life when you spent most of your time killing things for coin.

Kaelen took another sip and let his gaze drift across the tavern's common room. The Rusty Blade was living up to its name tonight: dull, worn, and probably dangerous if you grabbed it the wrong way. A dozen patrons hunched over their drinks, each one looking like they'd rather be anywhere else. He could relate.

"Another round for the gentleman?"

The barmaid—Sera, or Sara, or something starting with 'S'—leaned over the counter with a smile that was probably supposed to be sultry. It mostly just looked tired. Kaelen slid a copper across the scarred wood.

"Keep them coming. I've got nowhere to be."

"Story of everyone's life in Oakhaven," she said, pouring from a pitcher that had seen better decades. "Though word is there might be work for sell-swords. Caravan master's been asking around."

Kaelen's fingers drummed against his ale mug. Work was work, and his coin purse was getting light enough to double as a kerchief. "What kind of caravan?"

"The kind that needs protection getting through the Whispering Woods. Usual route to Arcanis."

"The usual route," Kaelen repeated, "where the usual bandits like to make usual corpses out of unusual travelers?"

She shrugged, which did interesting things to her blouse. Kaelen noticed in the abstract way a man notices the weather—present, acknowledged, but ultimately inconsequential.

"Pay's supposed to be good. Twenty silver for the trip."

Twenty silver. That was more than good; that was suspicious. Kaelen had escorted plenty of merchants in his three years of wandering, and ten silver was the high end for a milk run to the capital. Twenty meant they expected trouble. Real trouble.

"I'll think about it," he said, which meant he'd already decided yes. His principles had died with his village. His pragmatism was alive and kicking.

The barmaid moved on to other customers, and Kaelen settled deeper into his chair. The wood creaked under his weight—all lean muscle and bad memories wrapped in worn leather armor. His twin swords rested against the table leg, always within reach. An old habit from older times.

The tavern door banged open, admitting a gust of spring air and three men who walked like they owned the place. That was Kaelen's first warning sign. The second was that they were too clean for Oakhaven, their clothes too fine, their weapons too well-maintained. Mercenaries, maybe, but successful ones. The kind that didn't drink in places like The Rusty Blade unless they were hunting something.

Or someone.

Kaelen kept his posture relaxed, his eyes half-lidded, the very picture of a man deep in his cups. It was an act he'd perfected over the years. Drunks were ignored. Drunks were dismissed. Drunks survived.

The leader of the trio—a broad-shouldered man with a scar bisecting his left eyebrow—scanned the room with professional efficiency. His gaze skipped over Kaelen without pause. Good.

They settled at a corner table, ordering food and wine with the casual arrogance of men accustomed to having their demands met. Kaelen watched them through the reflection in his mug, an old scout's trick. You could learn a lot about people by how they acted when they thought no one was looking.

These three were disciplined. Military discipline, not mere mercenary work. They sat with their backs to walls, weapons positioned for quick draw, eyes constantly moving. And there was something else, something that made Kaelen's instincts itch like a healing wound.

The way they moved was wrong. Too smooth, too fast. Enhanced, his mind supplied. Magic or alchemy or something worse.

"—war's coming, mark my words," someone said at the next table over, voice loud with drink and conviction.

"War's always coming," his companion replied. "Nobles can't go a decade without swinging their dicks at each other."

"No, this is different. Eldoria and Aridia are really going at it. Border skirmishes turning into full battles. Friend of mine, he's got family in the southern reaches, says whole villages are being burned."

Kaelen's fingers tightened around his mug. Burned villages. Of course.

The conversation continued, but he'd stopped listening. Memories crowded in uninvited: flames licking at thatch roofs, screams cutting through the night, the smell of burning flesh that never quite left your nostrils no matter how much time passed. His village had burned seven years ago. Bandits, they'd said. Random violence, they'd said.

He'd been fifteen and stupid and convinced he could make a difference. By the time he'd gotten back from fetching water at the stream, everyone he'd ever known was dead or dying. His father. His mother. Little Kira from next door who'd always laughed at his terrible jokes.

All ashes. All echoes.

Kaelen drained his ale and signaled for another. The barmaid obliged, and he paid without comment. The three suspicious newcomers were still talking in low voices, occasionally glancing around the room. Definitely hunting something.

Probably not him, though. Kaelen made it a point not to make enemies important enough to send enhanced killers after him. He took small jobs, kept his head down, and tried not to think too much about the fact that his life had become a monotonous cycle of violence and survival.

The door opened again. This time it was an older man, well-dressed in merchant's finery, with a face like wrinkled leather and eyes sharp enough to cut glass. He surveyed the room, spotted Kaelen, and started walking over.

"You the sell-sword Kaelen?" he asked without preamble.

"Depends on who's asking and what they want."

"Name's Horvath. I've got a caravan leaving for Arcanis at dawn. Need guards who can handle themselves if things go sideways in the Whispering Woods."

"And you think I'm your man because...?"

"Because Sera tells me you've been asking about work, and because I've been asking about you." Horvath pulled out a chair and sat without invitation. "You're not local, been drifting through border towns for years, always moving, never staying long enough to put down roots. You don't drink yourself stupid, don't gamble away your coin, and don't start fights you can't finish. That makes you either smart or paranoid. Either way, useful."

Kaelen studied the merchant. Horvath had the look of a man who'd spent his life reading people—knowing when to trust, when to run, when to negotiate. The kind of man who survived in the spaces between kingdoms.

"Twenty silver seems high for a simple escort job."

"It's not a simple escort job, which you've already figured out because you're not an idiot." Horvath leaned forward, voice dropping. "Truth is, I've lost two caravans in the last month. Professional hits, not random bandits. Someone's targeting my goods, or me, or both. I need people who can fight, and I need them to not ask too many questions about what they're protecting."

"And if I do ask questions?"

"Then I tell you it's legal goods, properly taxed, nothing that'll bring the kingdom's justice down on your head. Beyond that, what you don't know can't be tortured out of you if things go really sideways."

Dark humor. Kaelen appreciated that. "Who else are you hiring?"

"You'd be the fourth. Got a spearman out of Kharaz'Mar, a mage apprentice who swears she can throw fire, and a tracker who knows the Whispering Woods like his own bedroom."

A dwarven spearman, a mage, and a ranger. Standard adventuring party composition, which meant Horvath had been at this awhile. Kaelen nodded slowly.

"Thirty silver."

"Twenty-five and I throw in a bonus if we make it without losing cargo."

"Deal." Kaelen extended his hand. Horvath shook it with a grip like iron.

"Dawn, at the east gate. Don't be late." The merchant stood, tossed a few coins on the table for drinks, and left as abruptly as he'd arrived.

Kaelen sat back, processing. A well-paying job with obvious danger was still better than draining his coin purse on cheap ale while waiting for life to give him purpose. At least this way he'd be doing something.

The three enhanced men chose that moment to stand up. They settled their tab, exchanged quiet words, and moved toward the door with that same too-smooth gait. As they passed Kaelen's table, the scarred leader glanced down at him—really looked this time, as if cataloging features for later reference.

Then they were gone, night swallowing them whole.

Kaelen stared at the door for a long moment. Maybe it was paranoia. Maybe it was pattern recognition. Either way, his instincts were screaming that something was very wrong in Oakhaven. In Eldoria. In the whole damn world.

He finished his ale, paid his tab, and headed upstairs to the room he'd been renting by the week. It was small, sparse, and had a window that opened onto the back alley—always important to have an exit strategy. His pack was already organized, a habit from years of needing to run at a moment's notice. Weapons cleaned and sharpened. Armor mended. Provisions packed.

Kaelen lay down on the bed without bothering to undress, hands behind his head, staring at the water-stained ceiling. Sleep would come eventually. It always did, though never peacefully. The dead had a way of visiting in dreams, asking questions he couldn't answer.

*Why did you survive?*
*Why didn't you save us?*
*Why do you keep running?*

He didn't have good answers. He'd stopped looking for them around the same time he'd stopped looking for meaning in anything beyond survival.

Tomorrow he'd guard a caravan. Maybe get paid. Maybe die in the woods. Both seemed equally likely, equally inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.

Kaelen closed his eyes and waited for the ghosts to arrive.

---

Dawn came too early and too bright, which was typical for spring in Eldoria. Kaelen rolled out of bed, splashed water on his face from the washbasin, and strapped on his swords with the practiced efficiency of a man who'd been doing it half his life.

The twin blades were nothing special—good steel, decent balance, reliable. He'd won them off a dead mercenary in Kharaz'Mar who'd been stupid enough to take a contract against a dragon cult. The idiot had died. Kaelen had taken his swords and learned a valuable lesson about knowing when a job was above your pay grade.

He made his way downstairs. The common room was mostly empty at this hour, just a few early risers nursing hangovers with hair-of-the-dog remedies. Sera—definitely Sera, he'd checked the pronunciation—waved from behind the bar.

"Off to make your fortune?"

"Off to not die in the woods," Kaelen corrected. "The fortune is negotiable."

She laughed, which was probably more than his mediocre wit deserved. "Try to come back in one piece. You're one of my better customers."

"I pay my tab and don't vomit on the floor. I'm a paragon of virtue."

"In Oakhaven, that qualifies you for sainthood."

Kaelen couldn't argue with that. He settled his pack more comfortably and headed for the east gate.

Oakhaven was already stirring with morning activity. Farmers bringing produce to market, craftsmen opening shops, guards changing watch at the wooden palisade that marked the town's perimeter. It was all so normal, so mundane, that Kaelen found it vaguely offensive. Didn't these people know the world was falling apart?

But then, maybe they did. Maybe they just kept going anyway because the alternative was lying down and waiting to die. Maybe that made them braver than him.

The east gate stood open, and Horvath's caravan was already assembled. Three wagons, each drawn by a pair of sturdy horses. The cargo was covered with canvas tarps, tied down tight. Professional work.

Horvath himself stood near the lead wagon, talking with three figures who must be the other guards. Kaelen approached, taking stock of his temporary companions.

The dwarf was easy to spot—about four and a half feet of compact muscle, wearing scale mail that had been polished to a mirror shine. His spear leaned against the wagon, easily seven feet long with a wicked crossbar near the head. Practical weapon for someone who fought taller opponents. His beard was braided with silver rings, and his eyes had that peculiar intensity dwarves got when they were sizing up potential allies or enemies.

The mage apprentice was younger than Kaelen expected—maybe eighteen, with the kind of soft features that suggested she'd grown up in wealth before deciding to pursue the arcane arts. Her robes were quality work, deep blue with silver embroidery along the hems. A staff of polished oak rested in her grip, topped with a crystal that currently wasn't doing anything magical. She looked nervous, which was either refreshingly honest or deeply concerning.

The tracker was harder to read. Human, male, maybe in his thirties, with the lean, weathered look of someone who spent more time in forests than cities. He wore mottled greens and browns, carried a bow that looked like it could punch through plate armor, and had the stillness of a man who'd learned to wait for prey.

"Ah, Kaelen," Horvath said, gesturing him over. "Meet your fellow guards. This is Gorim"—the dwarf nodded curtly—"Elise"—the mage apprentice smiled tentatively—"and Rakken"—the tracker didn't react at all.

"Morning," Kaelen offered, receiving various acknowledgments in return.

"Now that we're all here," Horvath continued, "let's go over the basics. We're taking the main road through the Whispering Woods to Arcanis. It's a three-day journey if we don't hit problems. The woods have a reputation for bandits, wild beasts, and generally being a shit place to die, so stay alert. Gorim, you'll take point. Rakken, you scout ahead and sides. Elise, you ride with me on the lead wagon. Kaelen, you've got the rear."

Standard formation. Kaelen nodded his acceptance.

"Anything specific we should know about the cargo?" Gorim asked, his voice a bass rumble with the distinctive gravel of the dwarven accent.

"It's valuable, it's legal, and it's insured," Horvath replied. "Beyond that, what you don't know can't hurt you. Well, it can hurt you, but not in a legal sense."

Rakken the tracker finally spoke, his voice surprisingly soft. "Heard you lost caravans recently. Bandits or something else?"

"If I knew that, I'd have hired an army instead of four very competent-looking but ultimately limited sell-swords." Horvath smiled without humor. "Let's assume the worst and be pleasantly surprised if we're wrong."

"The worst," Elise said quietly, "being those shadow-touched warriors everyone's been talking about? The enhanced ones working for... well, no one's quite sure who they're working for."

Silence greeted that observation. Kaelen thought about the three men from the tavern last night and said nothing.

"Shadow-touched are myths," Gorim declared. "Stories to scare children and gullible humans."

"Myths that have killed quite a few people recently," Rakken observed.

"Enough." Horvath's voice cut through the building argument. "Myths, enhanced warriors, or plain old bandits with delusions of grandeur—it doesn't matter. Our job is to get this caravan to Arcanis. Everything else is academic until it's trying to kill us. Everyone clear?"

Various nods and grunts of agreement.

"Good. Mount up, gear up, and let's get moving. I want to make the Clearwater waystation by nightfall."

The group dispersed to their positions. Kaelen took up station at the rear wagon, doing a final check of his weapons and gear. The twin swords slid from their sheaths with the whisper of steel on leather—a good sound, a ready sound. He sheathed them again and settled into the comfortable readiness of a man expecting violence.

The caravan lurched into motion. Horvath snapped the reins, and the horses plodded forward with the resigned patience of beasts who'd made this journey many times before. They passed through the east gate, waved on by guards who looked bored enough to be comatose, and headed into the rolling hills that marked the approach to the Whispering Woods.

Kaelen walked beside the rear wagon, eyes scanning the road behind them. Already Oakhaven was disappearing into the distance, its wooden palisade shrinking to a dark line against the green landscape. The sky was clear, the spring air pleasantly cool, and birds sang in the scattered trees that dotted the roadside.

It was, objectively, a beautiful morning.

Kaelen didn't trust it for a second.

The first few hours passed uneventfully. The road was well-maintained this close to Oakhaven—flat, wide, with drainage ditches on either side to prevent washouts during heavy rains. Farmers worked in distant fields, occasionally waving to the passing caravan. Normal. Peaceful.

Kaelen kept expecting an ambush anyway.

Gorim maintained his position at the front, spear resting comfortably on his shoulder, eyes constantly moving. The dwarf knew his business, which was reassuring. Rakken appeared and disappeared like a ghost, sometimes visible as a shadow in the tree line, sometimes utterly invisible. Also reassuring, in a different way.

Elise sat on the wagon seat next to Horvath, trying very hard to look confident and experienced. She was fooling exactly no one, but Kaelen appreciated the effort. Everyone started somewhere. For him, it had been a burning village and a desperate need to survive. For her, maybe it was student loans at the Arcanis Academy of Arcane Arts. Different roads, same destination: trying not to die.

Around midday, the terrain began to change. The rolling hills gave way to flatter ground, and the scattered trees thickened into proper forest. The Whispering Woods earned their name from the constant susurrus of wind through dense foliage—a sound like distant voices, just below the threshold of comprehension. It had driven more than one traveler mad over the years, or so the stories went.

Kaelen thought the real danger wasn't the whispering but the visibility. Thick woods meant limited sight lines, plenty of cover for ambushes, and a dozen ways to die before you even knew you were in a fight.

"Stay sharp," he called forward to Elise. She nodded, fingers tightening around her staff.

The road narrowed as it entered the woods proper, hemmed in by massive oaks and elms that had been here since before Eldoria existed. Sunlight filtered through the canopy in shifting patterns, creating a dappled world of light and shadow. Beautiful and deadly in equal measure.

Rakken materialized beside Kaelen so suddenly he nearly drew steel on reflex.

"Tracks," the ranger said without preamble. "Fresh. Party of six, maybe eight, paralleling the road about fifty yards north. Armed and moving with purpose."

"Bandits?"

"Maybe. Or merchants with sense enough to stay off the road. Or hunters. Or..." Rakken trailed off, which was somehow more ominous than if he'd finished the sentence.

"You're a font of reassurance."

The ghost of a smile touched Rakken's weathered face. "I aim to please. I'm going to scout ahead, see if they're setting up an ambush point. Keep everyone alert."

He vanished into the underbrush like he'd never been there at all. Kaelen moved up the line of wagons until he was within speaking distance of Horvath.

"We've got company. Rakken says armed group paralleling us to the north."

Horvath didn't look surprised, which told Kaelen the merchant had probably already spotted signs himself. "How many?"

"Six to eight."

"Bad odds for them if they're planning a direct attack. We've got four competent fighters and three wagons of high ground." Horvath's hands were steady on the reins, but Kaelen noticed he'd loosened the peace-strap on the short sword at his belt. "They'll wait for an advantage point. Narrow road, maybe a deadfall across the path, somewhere we can't maneuver."

"Comforting thought."

"I'm a merchant, not a comfort provider."

Kaelen returned to his position at the rear, senses on high alert. The whispering of the woods seemed louder now, more insistent, like the trees themselves were trying to warn them. Or maybe that was just his paranoia talking. Hard to tell the difference anymore.

Minutes crawled past. The shadows grew longer as afternoon stretched toward evening. Still no sign of attack, but the pressure kept building—a feeling like thunderstorms gathering on the horizon, all potential energy and nowhere to go but explosive release.

Then Gorim's voice rang out: "Hold up! Deadfall across the road!"

The caravan stopped. Kaelen moved forward quickly, one hand on a sword hilt. Ahead, a massive oak had fallen across the path—fresh fall, too, with green leaves still attached and sawdust visible at the base where it had been cut.

"Ambush," Horvath said flatly. "Everyone get ready."

No sooner had the words left his mouth than figures emerged from the woods on both sides of the road. Not bandits. Worse.

Eight men in mismatched armor, but all moving with that same too-smooth gait Kaelen had seen in the tavern. Enhanced. And leading them was the scarred man from last night, wearing a smile like a knife.

"Horvath," the scarred man called out cheerfully. "Fancy meeting you here. You really should vary your routes more. Predictability is so dangerous in times like these."

"I don't know you," Horvath replied, though his white-knuckled grip on the reins suggested otherwise.

"No, but I know you. More specifically, I know what you're carrying. Magical components bound for the royal academy in Arcanis. Very valuable. Very needed for certain... experiments. We'll be taking those now."

"Over my cold corpse," Gorim growled, leveling his spear.

"That can be arranged, master dwarf. Though honestly, we'd prefer not to kill you. Professional courtesy between warriors and all that. Just walk away, let us take the cargo, and everyone lives to fight another day."

Kaelen studied the situation with tactical detachment. Eight enhanced warriors against four guards and a merchant. Terrible odds. The deadfall blocked any forward escape, and the wagons couldn't turn around quickly enough. The enemy had chosen their ambush point perfectly.

Standard tactics would suggest surrender and live to fight another day.

Kaelen had never been particularly good at standard tactics.

"Counter-offer," he called out, stepping forward with his hands nowhere near his swords. "You eight turn around, disappear into the woods, and maybe I don't kill you all. Saves everyone a lot of tedious bloodshed."

The scarred leader laughed, a sound of genuine amusement. "Brave words from one man."

"Who said I was alone?"

On cue, Rakken's arrow took one of the enhanced warriors in the throat. The man went down choking on his own blood, surprise clear in his dying eyes. Enhanced or not, anatomy was anatomy.

"Ah, shit," Kaelen sighed. "I was hoping they'd actually run. I hate it when they don't run."

Then the forest exploded into violence, and talking time was over.

The enhanced warriors moved fast—faster than humans should move. But Kaelen had been fighting things faster than him his entire career. Speed meant nothing if you couldn't predict where the attack was coming from.

The first warrior came at him with twin daggers, all flash and fury. Kaelen sidestepped, drew his left sword, and cut the man's hamstrings in one smooth motion. The warrior dropped, screaming, and Kaelen's right sword ended it.

Two down. Six to go.

Gorim had engaged two warriors at once, his spear a blur of jabs and sweeps. The dwarf fought with the compact efficiency of his people—no wasted motion, every strike purposeful. One warrior went down with a spear through the chest. The other circled warily.

Elise was chanting, hands glowing with gathering power. Kaelen hoped she actually knew what she was doing and wasn't about to blow them all up.

Horvath had drawn his sword and was fending off one attacker with surprising skill. The merchant clearly wasn't just a merchant.

Which left three enhanced warriors and the scarred leader converging on Kaelen.

"Well," he muttered, drawing his second sword. "This is going to hurt."

They attacked in concert, which showed training. Kaelen parried the first strike, ducked the second, and took the third on his vambrace with a clang that sent shock up his arm. His counterattack forced them back a step, but only a step.

The scarred leader watched from the side, evaluating. Smart. Let his subordinates test the threat first.

Kaelen felt the old familiar rhythm settling over him—the dance of combat, where thought became irrelevant and instinct took over. Parry, strike, riposte. Deflect, sidestep, counter. His blades wove patterns in the air, steel singing its ancient song.

One of the warriors overextended. Kaelen's sword found the gap in his armor, right under the ribs. The man gasped and fell.

Fire erupted from Elise's staff, a gout of flame that caught one of Gorim's opponents and sent him screaming. The dwarf capitalized immediately, spear punching through the burning man's throat.

Rakken continued his deadly archery from the trees. Another enhanced warrior dropped with an arrow through his eye.

The scarred leader's expression went from amused to annoyed. "Enough of this. Kill them all."

He drew his sword—a blade that seemed to drink in light rather than reflect it, shadow magic made manifest. Dangerous. Very dangerous.

Kaelen engaged the last two warriors with renewed urgency. He needed to finish them before their leader joined the fight, or this would get very ugly very fast.

His right sword caught one warrior's blade in a bind. His left stabbed forward, punching through leather armor into lung. The man's eyes widened in shock. Kaelen ripped the blade free and spun to face the last underling.

This one was better. Faster. His enhanced speed actually meant something backed by skill. They traded blows, steel ringing on steel, neither gaining advantage.

Then the scarred leader attacked Gorim from behind.

"Dwarf! Look out!" Kaelen shouted.

Gorim tried to turn, but too slow. The shadow blade would have taken his head—

Except Horvath was there, sword up, intercepting the strike with a crash of steel on shadow-stuff that sent sparks flying. The merchant grimaced with effort, muscles straining to hold back the enhanced leader's strength.

"Get these wagons moving!" Horvath yelled. "I'll hold him!"

"Like hell," Gorim snarled, moving to flank.

Kaelen's opponent used the distraction to press an attack. Blade came at Kaelen's throat. He twisted, felt steel kiss his cheek in a hot line of pain, and retaliated with a vicious slash that opened the warrior's arm to the bone.

The man screamed and stumbled back. Kaelen didn't give him time to recover—three quick strikes, the last taking the warrior's head clean off.

Eight down. One to go.

The scarred leader was holding his own against both Horvath and Gorim, that shadow blade moving in patterns that defied normal physics. Where it struck metal, weapons cracked. Where it struck flesh, it left wounds that smoked and refused to bleed properly.

Elise was chanting again, building power. Rakken had moved position, trying for a clean shot but unable to risk hitting the friendlies.

Kaelen assessed the situation in a heartbeat. The leader was too strong, too fast, and that shadow blade was the real problem. They needed to disarm him or distract him long enough for a killing blow.

Or they needed someone stupid enough to try something reckless.

"Guess I'm nominated," Kaelen muttered and charged.

He hit the melee at full speed, both swords aimed at the leader's back. The scarred man somehow sensed him coming—supernatural awareness, probably—and spun to engage. Their blades met in a shriek of steel on shadow.

Up close, Kaelen could see that the leader's eyes weren't quite right. Too bright. Too knowing. Too wrong.

"You're better than expected," the man said conversationally while trying to kill him. "Most mercenaries would have run by now."

"I'm not most mercenaries," Kaelen grunted, parrying a strike that nearly tore his sword from his grip. "I'm the one having a spectacularly bad day and taking it out on people who really should have stayed in bed."

The leader laughed and pressed his attack. Kaelen gave ground, both blades working desperately to keep that shadow sword away from vital organs. Gorim and Horvath flanked, forcing the leader to split his attention.

"Now, Elise!" Rakken's voice from the trees.

The mage apprentice released her spell. A lance of pure fire, white-hot and concentrated, streaked across the clearing. The scarred leader saw it coming but was engaged on three fronts with nowhere to dodge.

The fire lance caught him in the shoulder and kept going, punching through armor and flesh and bone. The smell of burning meat filled the air. The leader staggered, his shadow blade flickering.

Gorim's spear found his throat.

Horvath's sword took him in the heart.

Kaelen's blade removed his head, just to be sure.

The enhanced leader fell in pieces, and the shadow blade shattered into wisps of darkness that dissipated on the wind.

Silence descended on the Whispering Woods, broken only by heavy breathing and the crackle of dying fires.

"Everyone alive?" Horvath asked after a moment.

Various affirmatives, though Gorim was nursing a nasty gash on his arm and Elise looked like she might vomit. Kaelen touched his cheek where the blade had kissed him—shallow cut, would scar but nothing serious.

Rakken emerged from the woods, already retrieving his arrows from corpses. Waste not, want not.

"Well," Horvath said, surveying the carnage. "That was unpleasant."

"You can say that again," Gorim rumbled.

"That was unpleasant."

Despite everything, Kaelen found himself smiling. "You hire interesting caravans, Horvath."

"I pay interesting wages." The merchant was already moving to check his cargo. "Let's clear this deadfall and get moving. I want distance between us and this mess before dark."

They worked together to shift the fallen oak—Gorim's dwarven strength proving invaluable—and got the caravan moving again. As they rolled past the scene of the battle, Kaelen took one last look at the bodies.

Enhanced warriors. Shadow blades. Professional ambush.

This wasn't random banditry. This was organized, funded, and dangerous.

And according to the tavern gossip, war was coming between Eldoria and Aridia.

Kaelen had a bad feeling the two were connected. More than that, he had the terrible suspicion that whatever was coming was going to make a simple ambush in the woods look like a pleasant diversion.

But that was tomorrow's problem. Today's problem was getting to the Clearwater waystation alive.

One problem at a time. That's how you survived.

That's all survival was, really—solving one problem after another until you ran out of problems or ran out of life.

Kaelen touched his swords, feeling their familiar weight, and followed the caravan deeper into the Whispering Woods.

Behind him, the bodies cooled and the ravens gathered.

Ahead, the road wound on toward Arcanis, toward war, toward a destiny he couldn't yet see but could feel approaching like storm clouds on the horizon.

The dance had begun, though Kaelen didn't know it yet.

Life and death, spinning together in patterns older than kingdoms and more inevitable than dawn.

And he was right in the middle of it all, twin swords in hand, heading into the darkness with nothing but skill and stubbornness to keep him alive.

It would have to be enough.

It always had been before.
