# Book 1: The Dance of Life and Death
## Chapter 3: When Darkness Wakes

**ARCANIS - THE CITY OF LIGHT**

The gates of Arcanis should have been magnificent. Three stories of enchanted white stone, inscribed with protective wards that had stood for five hundred years, crowned with the silver banner of Eldoria streaming in the wind.

Instead, they were a chokepoint of chaos.

Kaelen stood in what passed for a line, watching guards try to process the flood of refugees while maintaining some semblance of security. It wasn't going well. People shouted, children cried, and the smell of unwashed bodies and fear hung thick in the air.

"This is a disaster," Lyra observed beside him, bow slung across her back but hand never far from it. "They're not equipped for this volume of displaced people."

"No city is." Kaelen scanned the walls, noting the increased guard presence. Archers every ten feet, mages at strategic positions, and—his eyes narrowed—soldiers in ceremonial armor who looked distinctly unhappy about performing actual defensive duty. "But at least they're taking the threat seriously now."

"After demons literally crawled out of the ground, taking threats seriously seems like basic common sense."

"You'd be surprised how often common sense isn't."

Their part of the caravan had been split up at the gates. Horvath and his cargo wagons had been expedited through a merchant entrance—apparently magical components trumped refugee processing. Gorim had gone with him, citing responsibility to the contract. Rakken had simply vanished the way rangers did. Elise had been summarily appropriated by the Mages' Guild, leaving Kaelen and Lyra to shepherd their refugee group through the bureaucratic nightmare.

"Next!" the guard called, sounding like he'd rather be literally anywhere else.

A family shuffled forward—mother, father, three children under ten. The guard asked questions by rote: Names, place of origin, reason for seeking refuge, skills or trade. The father answered in the monotone of trauma, and Kaelen saw his own past reflected in those hollow eyes.

War made victims of everyone eventually.

"We're going to be here for hours," Lyra muttered. "And I'm getting a very bad feeling about the city's... energy. Something feels wrong."

Kaelen had learned to trust his instincts over years of survival, and Lyra's instincts had proven reliable. "Wrong how?"

"Can't explain it. Like pressure building before a storm. Makes my teeth ache." She touched the enchanted crystal on her bow absently. "Magic users might be feeling it stronger, but I'm just enough elf to sense something's off."

"Demons appearing might have something to do with that."

"No, this is different. Older. Bigger." Lyra shook her head. "Forget it. Probably just paranoia."

But Kaelen saw the tension in her shoulders, the way her eyes kept scanning skyward as if expecting something to fall on them. Whatever she was sensing, it had her genuinely worried.

And if something worried Lyra—cheerful, irreverent, seemingly fearless Lyra—then it was probably worth worrying about.

**AETHERIA - CELESTIA, THE RADIANT CAPITAL**

*Three hours earlier*

Elfiria woke from her meditation gasping, divine energy crackling across her skin like static electricity.

Wrong. Something was wrong. The connection to the celestial realm that sustained her powers, that marked her as Aasimar and High Priestess, suddenly felt... contaminated. As if darkness had begun seeping into a well of pure light.

She stood from her cushion in the private chapel, silver hair cascading around her shoulders, golden eyes wide with alarm. Her ceremonial robes—white and gold, imbued with protective enchantments—shimmered as divine power responded to her distress.

"My lady?" One of her attendants appeared in the doorway, concern evident. "We heard—is something amiss?"

"Send for the Council of High Priests immediately," Elfiria commanded, her normally gentle voice sharp with urgency. "And activate the sanctuary wards. Something is happening. Something terrible."

The attendant paled and hurried to obey. Elfiria moved to the chapel's viewing crystal—a device that allowed her to observe events across Mythosia through divine sight. She channeled power into it, seeking the source of the disturbance.

The vision that appeared made her blood turn to ice.

On a battlefield between Eldoria and Aridia—one of dozens scattered across the continent—thousands of soldiers lay dead or dying. But that wasn't what held her attention. At the center of the carnage, a ritual circle had been carved into the earth itself, drawn in blood and worse things. Dark-robed figures chanted in languages that predated human civilization.

And at the circle's heart, reality was tearing.

"No," Elfiria breathed. "It can't be. The seals should have held for another thousand years..."

But even as she watched, the tear widened. Void energy—pure entropy, the antithesis of creation—poured through like oil into water. The ritual circle pulsed with malevolent power as the chanting reached a crescendo.

Something was trying to force its way through from the Void.

Something ancient and hungry and powerful enough to make the very fabric of reality scream.

The Council of High Priests burst into the chapel, robes disheveled from hurrying. High Priest Ardeth, oldest and most experienced of them, took one look at the viewing crystal and went pale.

"The Demon King," he whispered. "After three centuries... the Demon King is returning."

"Can we stop it?" Elfiria demanded. "Can we reinforce the seals from here?"

"My lady, even combined, our power would be a candle against the sun." Ardeth's hands shook as he gripped his staff. "The amount of death energy being channeled into that ritual... it's feeding on the war itself. Every soldier who dies on those battlefields adds power to the resurrection."

"Then we evacuate. We warn the other kingdoms. We—"

The viewing crystal shattered.

Elfiria threw up a shield on instinct, divine light forming a barrier that deflected the glass shards. But the shattering wasn't mere physical trauma—the magical backlash sent her stumbling, power surging through her in painful spikes.

Across Mythosia, she felt it. Every magic user, every enchantment, every ward and spell suddenly reacted to a massive surge of void energy.

The Demon King had awakened.

**ARCANIS - THE CITY OF LIGHT**

Kaelen was still standing in line, contemplating the many ways bureaucracy was a special kind of torture, when every mage in sight collapsed screaming.

Chaos erupted instantly. Guards rushed to the fallen mages, civilians panicked, and somewhere an alarm bell started ringing with desperate urgency.

"What the—" Lyra began.

Then she stumbled, hand flying to her temple. "Oh gods. Oh gods, that's not good."

"Lyra!" Kaelen caught her before she fell, supporting her weight. "What's happening?"

"Power surge. Massive. Every ley line in Mythosia just screamed." Her emerald eyes were wide, pupils dilated with shock. "Something big just happened. Something world-breakingly big."

Around them, the collapsed mages were starting to recover, but they looked like they'd been through a personal apocalypse. One woman was crying. A man vomited violently. Another just stared into space with the thousand-yard stare Kaelen recognized from traumatized soldiers.

The guards were shouting orders, trying to restore order. Someone with captain's insignia climbed onto a platform and raised his voice magically.

"CITIZENS! Remain calm! We are investigating the magical disturbance! Return to your homes in an orderly—"

He didn't get to finish.

The sky split open.

Kaelen had seen a lot of disturbing things in his life, but nothing prepared him for watching reality literally tear apart. A crack appeared in the blue sky above Arcanis, spreading like broken ice, and through that crack poured darkness that hurt to look at.

Void energy. Even without magical sensitivity, Kaelen could feel it—wrongness made manifest, entropy and death and the ending of all things.

"RUN!" someone screamed.

The refugees scattered in blind panic. Guards tried to maintain order and failed spectacularly. Kaelen pulled Lyra toward the city walls, looking for shelter, for anywhere that might offer protection from whatever was coming.

"The barrier!" Lyra gasped, pointing. "The city has wards! Get inside the barrier!"

Kaelen could see it now—a faint shimmer of protective magic around Arcanis proper, distinct from the outer processing area where they'd been standing. He dragged Lyra toward the gate, shouldering through panicked civilians.

A guard tried to stop them. Kaelen showed his swords and his willingness to use them. The guard reconsidered and let them through.

They stumbled into Arcanis proper just as the void energy reached critical mass.

The city's wards flared to life, ancient magic meeting contemporary darkness in a collision that lit the sky like a second sun. Kaelen felt the shockwave through his boots, a physical percussion that rattled his teeth.

But the wards held.

Outside the barrier, the refugees who hadn't made it through in time screamed as void energy washed over them. Some simply... ceased. Not dead, not disintegrated—just erased, as if they'd never existed at all. Others twisted, corrupted, transforming into shrieking monsters that bore only passing resemblance to humanity.

"We have to help them!" Lyra tried to pull free of Kaelen's grip.

"We can't! The barrier—"

"I don't care about the barrier!"

"You should, because if you go out there, you'll die!" Kaelen forced her to look at him. "We can't help anyone if we're dead or corrupted. Focus."

Lyra's expression was anguished, but she stopped struggling. They watched helplessly as the void energy storm raged against the city's defenses.

After an eternity that lasted maybe two minutes, the storm began to dissipate. The crack in reality sealed itself, darkness receding like a tide going out. What remained was devastation—the ground outside the wards was scorched and twisted, and the corrupted victims wandered in confused circles, no longer human enough to understand what they'd become.

Archer squads on the walls began systematically putting arrows through skulls. Mercy killing.

Kaelen felt sick.

"What was that?" Lyra whispered, voice small and lost.

"Nothing good."

All across the city, alarm bells were ringing now. Soldiers rushed through streets, mages gathered in emergency councils, and priests of various gods called for calm while looking distinctly not calm themselves.

Kaelen pulled Lyra into an alley, away from the main thoroughfare. They needed information, needed to understand what they were dealing with.

"Your magical senses," he said. "Can you tell where that power came from?"

Lyra closed her eyes, breathing slowly. Her hands shook, but her voice steadied. "South. Far south. The border region between Eldoria and Aridia." She opened her eyes. "That's where the heaviest fighting has been. Gods. If this is connected to the war..."

"Then someone's been using the war as fuel for something worse."

The pieces clicked into place with horrible clarity. The shadow-enhanced warriors targeting caravans. The coordinated invasion that escalated too quickly. The demons appearing from nowhere.

None of it was random. It was all part of a plan.

And they'd just witnessed the plan's culmination.

**THE BATTLEFIELD - ARIDIA/ELDORIA BORDER**

General Marcus of Eldoria's Third Army had been a soldier for thirty years. He'd seen battles, sieges, skirmishes, and every flavor of military engagement imaginable. He considered himself unshakeable.

He was wrong.

The void energy that erupted from the ritual circle washed over both armies without discrimination. Eldorian and Aridian soldiers died in equal measure, screaming as darkness consumed them from within. The lucky ones died quickly. The unlucky transformed.

And when the energy dissipated, something remained at the ritual circle's center.

The Demon King.

It—he—was beautiful in the way that poisonous flowers are beautiful. Humanoid in shape but clearly not human, with features too perfect to be real. Skin like polished obsidian, eyes that held the light of dying stars, and an aura of power that made reality bend around him like heat shimmer.

Seven figures emerged from the void behind him, each radiating their own terrible presence. The Demon Generals, Marcus's mind supplied numbly. The Seven Heralds of Ending.

One of them—a woman in ebon armor with burning red eyes—stepped forward. General Malakor, Marcus remembered from ancient texts. The First General, Herald of Despair.

"Well," Malakor said, surveying the battlefield of corpses and corrupted soldiers with satisfaction. "How I've missed the mortal realm. The screaming is so much more satisfying when it's real."

The Demon King spoke, and his voice was the sound of civilizations falling. "This world rejected me once. Sealed me away in darkness for three hundred years." He smiled, and Marcus felt his bladder weaken. "I have returned to teach it the consequences of that mistake."

"My lord," another General said—Xylos, Herald of Suffering, if Marcus was reading the descriptions right. "Shall we begin the conquest?"

"Yes. But first..." The Demon King turned to look at the surviving soldiers—maybe three hundred out of the five thousand who'd been fighting here. "A demonstration. So those who survive can carry the message."

Marcus tried to run.

He made it three steps before Malakor appeared in front of him, moving faster than thought. Her hand closed around his throat, lifting him like he weighed nothing.

"You," she said, studying him with clinical interest. "You're an officer. Important enough to be missed, not important enough to warrant protection." She smiled. "Perfect messenger."

Then she threw him.

Marcus hit the ground sixty feet away hard enough to crack ribs. Through vision blurred with pain, he watched as the Demon Generals attacked.

It wasn't a battle. It was a slaughter. An exhibition of power so overwhelming that resistance was meaningless.

General Xylos turned fifty soldiers inside out with a gesture.

General Vex, Herald of Plague, breathed out miasma that melted flesh from bone.

General Dravos, Herald of War, cut through armor and bodies alike with a blade that left afterimages of screaming souls.

On and on, seven Generals demonstrating seven different ways to die, while the Demon King watched with evident satisfaction.

When it was over, only Marcus remained alive. Him and a handful of others, specifically spared to spread the message.

Malakor walked over to where Marcus lay broken and trembling. She crouched beside him, close enough that he could smell the void-stench of her.

"Tell your kingdoms," she said softly. "Tell them that the Demon King has returned. Tell them that their war was orchestrated from the beginning—fuel for his resurrection. Tell them that their petty human conflicts mean nothing in the face of what's coming." She stood. "Tell them to prepare for extinction."

Then the Demons vanished, leaving Marcus alone on a field of the dead.

He lay there for a long time, broken in body and spirit, and eventually began to crawl toward help.

Someone had to warn them.

Someone had to tell them what was coming.

Even if no one would believe it.

Even if belief wouldn't save them.

**ARCANIS - THE PALACE**

The King's emergency council convened within the hour. Representatives from the Mages' Guild, the military, the churches, and merchant guilds all crammed into the council chamber that suddenly felt far too small.

Kaelen and Lyra shouldn't have been there—they were nobody, just a mercenary and a refugee escort. But Horvath had pulled strings (and possibly called in favors that would cost him later) to get them entry, reasoning that eyewitness accounts of demon attacks were valuable.

So they stood in the back of the chamber, trying to be inconspicuous, while people far more important argued about the end of the world.

"—cannot be the Demon King, that's impossible—"

"—witnesses report void energy levels consistent with historical records—"

"—need to mobilize the army immediately—"

"—against what? We don't even know where the demons are—"

"ENOUGH!" King Aldric of Eldoria slammed his hand on the council table, and blessed silence descended. He was a man in his fifties, gray-bearded and sharp-eyed, wearing the weight of his crown like a physical burden. "Archmage Selene. Give me facts, not speculation."

The Archmage of Arcanis stepped forward—an elderly woman with power crackling in her wake. "Your Majesty. I have confirmed reports from our scrying network. A massive void energy spike occurred at the Aridia border battlefield approximately three hours ago. Magical signatures match historical records of the Demon King from the last war." She paused. "Additionally, we've received messenger reports—scattered, terrified, but consistent. Demons have appeared at battlefields across the continent. They're targeting war zones specifically."

"How many demons?"

"Hundreds confirmed. Possibly thousands. And..." Selene's expression darkened. "Seven figures of extraordinary power have been identified. We believe these are the Demon Generals."

The council chamber erupted into panic. Kaelen listened to nobles and military leaders fall apart and thought, These are the people in charge of our survival?

Not encouraging.

King Aldric restored order again, looking decades older than he had minutes ago. "Options. What are our options?"

"Immediate armistice with Aridia and all other belligerent nations," the Royal Chancellor said. "We were fighting each other while being manipulated into fueling the Demon King's resurrection. That war ends now."

"Fortify the cities," General Markus suggested. "Pull back from the front lines, consolidate our forces—"

"And abandon everyone in the countryside to the demons?" a merchant guild representative protested.

"Better some survive than none!"

The argument spiraled again. Kaelen caught Lyra's eye and saw his own frustration reflected there.

"They're going to talk themselves in circles while people die," she murmured.

"People always do. The ones in power make speeches. The ones without power do the dying."

"Cheerful."

"Accurate."

A commotion at the chamber doors interrupted the council. Guards tried to stop whoever was approaching, failed, and stepped aside.

Elfiria entered the chamber, and Kaelen forgot how to breathe.

He'd seen beautiful women before. He'd bedded a few, forgotten more. Beauty was common enough if you looked for it.

This was different.

Elfiria didn't just enter a room—she transformed it. Her silver hair seemed to gather light, her golden eyes held depths that spoke of divine connection, and the sheer presence she radiated made everyone in the chamber straighten unconsciously. She wore ceremonial robes that marked her as both High Priestess and Queen of Aetheria, and divine power surrounded her like a visible corona.

She was, Kaelen's stunned brain supplied, the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen.

Also terrifying. And almost certainly untouchable.

Great.

"Your Majesty," Elfiria addressed King Aldric with a slight bow—equal speaking to equal. "I apologize for the intrusion, but Aetheria's interests must be represented in this council."

"Lady Elfiria." Aldric rose and returned the bow. "Of course. Please, join us."

She moved to the council table with liquid grace, and Kaelen forced himself to look away before staring became obvious. Beside him, Lyra smirked.

"You're drooling."

"Shut up."

"Poor swordsman. She's so far out of your league she's in a different sport entirely."

"I said shut up."

But Lyra was right, and they both knew it. Elfiria was royalty, priestess, and vessel for divine power. Kaelen was a mercenary with two swords and a talent for not dying. They existed in completely different worlds.

Still. A man could look.

"I have consulted with the celestial realm," Elfiria announced to the council. "The Demon King's return is confirmed. Moreover, my divine sight shows me his purpose." She paused, and even her hesitation was graceful. "He intends to consume Mythosia. Not conquer—consume. Feed on its life energy until nothing remains but void."

Silence greeted this pronouncement.

"How long do we have?" Aldric asked quietly.

"Months, perhaps. Less if he's unopposed. The demons will spread from the war zones, corrupting everything they touch. Each victory feeds them more power, accelerates the consumption."

"Then we fight." The King's jaw set. "We gather the kingdoms. Form an alliance—"

"Half the kingdoms are still at war with each other," someone protested.

"Then we convince them otherwise." Aldric's voice hardened with resolve. "Send messengers to every capital. Tell them what we face. Tell them that old grudges mean nothing if we're all extinct." He looked around the council. "We held back the Demon King once before, three centuries ago. We can do it again."

"That alliance had fifty kingdoms and the legendary Hero Valdris," Archmage Selene pointed out. "We have five kingdoms at most, and Valdris has been dead for three hundred years."

"Then we find a new hero. Or we make do with what we have." Aldric stood. "I want every soldier recalled from the war front. I want defensive wards around every city. I want the Mages' Guild working day and night on anti-void countermeasures. And I want a summit—neutral ground, all willing kingdoms, one week from today."

Orders went out. The council dissolved into focused activity. Kaelen watched important people rush off to do important things and thought, And what do I do?

His part in this seemed to be over. He'd survived the demons, made it to Arcanis, and witnessed the revelation of the threat. Now the real powers would take over.

He should collect his pay from Horvath and leave. Find some quiet corner of the world to wait out the apocalypse.

Except when he looked at the refugees outside the barrier—the ones who'd been transformed or erased or mercy-killed—he saw his village burning again. Saw people who'd depended on heroes and powers-that-be to save them, and died anyway.

The people in charge always made speeches.

The people without power did the dying.

Kaelen was so tired of watching people die.

"I know that look," Lyra said quietly. "That's the 'I'm about to do something stupid' look."

"I'm thinking about staying. Helping."

"That is extremely stupid." She smiled. "I'm in."

"You don't have to—"

"I know. But I'm going to anyway." Lyra straightened, hand on her bow. "Because someone has to help. Might as well be us."

They stood in the back of the chamber, two people against the end of the world, and Kaelen thought, This is insane.

But then, sanity had never been his strong suit.

The Demon King had risen.

War consumed the kingdoms.

And Kaelen, mercenary and survivor, made the decision to stop running.

Just this once.

He hoped it wouldn't kill him.

Though honestly, the odds weren't great.
