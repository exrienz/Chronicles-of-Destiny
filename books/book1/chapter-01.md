# Chapter 1: Glide-Rail Sparks

*POV: Kael Ardor, with interludes from Lyria and Rowan*

The glide-rail hummed beneath Kael's boots like a restless dragon. Aether runes pulsed along the track, blue light racing toward the distant silhouette of **Sunspoke Keep**. Above, the floating isles of Aetheria glittered, their chains trembling with the wind. Kael adjusted the consent seals on his gauntlets and grinned at the blur beside him.

Lyria Skydance leaned low over her **whimwheel**, braids whipping back. “Try to keep up, flame-boy. First one to the gate gets bragging rights and a whispered confession.”

“Only if you finally admit you like my cooking,” Kael shot back, coaxing his hover-board to accelerate. Sparks of orange mana spilled from his fingers, leaving a glittering contrail. The sparks turned pink and exploded harmlessly—his signature misfire. Lyria’s laughter echoed over the rails.

Rowan Thorne paced them from the forest path, tail swishing. The beastkin scout pretended disinterest, but every so often a ribbon of illusory silk flicked out from his wrist to flap against Kael’s backplate. Each time Kael swatted, the ribbon phased through with a faint chiming noise.

“Prankwright apprentices everywhere salute you, Rowan,” Kael muttered.

“Consider it an honor guard,” Rowan called. “Also, you’re losing!”

The rails curved toward Sunspoke’s primary gate. Kael’s mana flared. Lyria surged ahead, chanting a wind thread that caught her wheel like a sail. Kael braided a quick burst of flame under his board. For a heartbeat they were side by side, city walls ahead, banners snapping. The scent of cloudbread and ember-ale wafted on the air, mingling with the oily tang of magitech engines.

A shriek cut the wind. Kael’s danger sense pricked as a shadow darted across the rails. From the underbrush, a cluster of dark spheres shot upward—runes etched with crude demonic sigils.

“Sabotage!” Lyria cried. Her board jerked as a sphere latched to the track and began to sizzle.

Kael didn’t think. He extended his left hand, weaving two quick sigil threads: **dampen** and **shunt**. Fire magic wasn’t suited to delicate work, but he forced precision. The sphere vibrated and popped, releasing a cloud of purple smoke that smelled like burned sugar. Glitter coated Kael’s face.

Rowan vaulted onto the rail, claws digging in. “Two more ahead!” he warned. Lyria’s wheel swerved. Kael blasted a flame pulse, turning one sphere to molten slag. Lyria lobbed a gust rune at the other, sending it flying into the river with a comic hiss.

They slowed as Sunspoke’s gate guardians leveled halberds, confusion on their faces. Kael raised his hands. “Unexpected fireworks. Someone seeded the rails. Might want your engineers to check the rest.”

One guard stared at Kael’s glitter-splattered hair and tried to keep a straight face. “Understood, sir.”

Lyria bowed with flourish. “Fastest courier wins,” she whispered near Kael’s ear. Her breath smelled of sylvan nectar. She slipped a small charm into his palm—a silver feather inscribed with swirling lines. “Records a single confession. Hold it to your lips when you’re ready to lose.”

Kael’s heart thumped. “You’re assuming I lose?”

“Confidence is adorable,” Lyria teased. “Besides, you owe me for saving your face from glitterdom.”

Rowan sauntered past, tail ribbon fluttering. “I call this one a tie. Whoever admits their feelings first wins the rematch.”

### The Ceremony at Sunspoke

Sunspoke Keep bustled with officers, runists, and messengers. The **Glitter Mug** tavern clanged with laughter as prank illusions drifted—miniature dragons breathing bubbles, transparent chairs that slid away just before someone sat. Rowan’s ribbons stuck to Kael’s shoulder pauldron, a satin badge of mischief.

Inside the main hall, banners of the Alliance of Light hung beside fresh scorch marks. Elfiria Lumen stood near the dais, haloed by the faint glow of the **Holy Dome** relic. Beside her, Seris Valen polished a runic interface, his expression somewhere between pride and exhaustion.

Elfiria raised a hand as Kael and Lyria approached. “Your rail entry was…flashy.”

Kael cleared glitter from his brow. “Saboteurs planted demonic spheres on the line. We neutralized three; more might lurk.”

Seris arched an eyebrow. “Hence the glitter?”

Lyria smirked. “Kael likes to make an entrance.”

Rowan bowed. “With respect, lady Elfiria, the sabotage felt like a test run. Whoever placed them had minimal craft. Perhaps to cause panic rather than destruction.”

Elfiria’s gaze hardened. “The Tri-Moon Council convenes within the hour. Bring your report.”

As the hall emptied, Lyria drifted closer to Kael. “You still owe me a whispered confession.”

Kael unclasped his gauntlet, feeling the feather charm’s cool metal. “I’ll record it when I have something worth saying.”

“Bold. Don’t wait too long; these charms erase after three moons.” Her eyes softened. “Kael, you made that precise shunt under pressure. You’re not just a firebrand.”

He shrugged, embarrassed. “Don’t spread that rumor. I enjoy my reckless mystique.”

Rowan dropped a ribbon on Kael’s head like a crown. “Long live King Reckless. Also, the guards keep snickering; might be the glitter beard.”

Kael rolled his eyes and batted the ribbon away. It multiplied into three, each bearing tiny doodled hearts. Lyria laughed until tears welled.

### Interlude: Lyria

Later, Lyria perched atop a balcony overlooking the training yard. Sunspoke Keep sprawled below, soldiers sparring, engineers calibrating glide-rails that fed into the courtyard. She flipped her feather charm between fingers, replaying Kael’s flustered expression.

He pretends arrogance, she mused, but he pulled that shunt thread smoother than half the runists I’ve met. The thought stirred warmth. Humor lingered in her chest like sweet smoke, but beneath it a serious spark glowed.

A messenger approached. “Lady Skydance, engineers confirmed sabotage runes were etched by an amateur. Perhaps a distraction.”

“A distraction from what?” Lyria asked.

The messenger hesitated. “Whispers of Sylvanaria scouts spotted near the rail hubs. Council fears espionage.”

Lyria frowned. Rowan wouldn’t sabotage his own alliance. The Veilborne liked stirring distrust. She pocketed the charm. Time to use wit and wheels before rumors burned bridges.

### Prankwright Trouble

Rowan found Kael near the armory, inspecting charred fragments of the demonic spheres. “Look,” Rowan said, pointing to the sigils. “See the messy loops? Not professional. Someone wants to be caught.”

“Or wants us to think it’s amateur,” Kael replied. “Either way, Tri-Moon will want answers.”

Rowan tugged on his tail ribbon and swapped it onto Kael’s belt. “Consider this a cloak of subtlety.”

Kael chuckled despite himself. “You’re impossible.”

A door opened. Seris approached with a small wooden box. “Prankwright illusions have been popping around the hall—chairs sliding, banners singing off-key. The engineers traced them to this.” He opened the box to reveal a harmless-looking rune stone pulsing with faint green light.

Kael peered in. “Harmless jokes or testing defenses?”

“Both,” Seris said. “If the Veilborne are involved, humor masks malice.”

Rowan sniffed the stone. “Smells like pine… and cheap perfume.”

Lyria joined them, windblown. “The council expects us in ten. Kael, brush off the glitter. Or don’t—might disarm them.”

Kael wiped at his jaw. The glitter refused to leave, shimmering stubbornly. Lyria smirked and produced a soft cloth scented with sky-breeze. As she dabbed his cheek, the closeness made Kael acutely aware of the warmth between them.

“Hold still,” she whispered. “There. Less disco, more dashing.”

Kael’s pulse quickened. He turned, pretending to examine the rune stone. “Thanks.”

### Tri-Moon Council

The council chamber was ringed by windows overlooking Sunspoke’s glide-rail hub. Eldoria’s general, Aetheria’s envoy, and Kharaz’Mar’s forge-lord occupied the crescent table with Elfiria at its center. As Kael, Lyria, Rowan, and Seris entered, illusions of laughing ravens circled the ceiling—a prank that drew weary chuckles.

Kael presented the charred sphere fragments. “Demonic etchings, placed clumsily on the inbound rail. We suspect a staged incident to spark mistrust.”

Forge-lord Darrum squinted. “These loops…childish.”

Lyria added, “Rumors already spread that Sylvanaria scouts were seen near the rails. Convenient scapegoat.”

Rowan stepped forward. “My people value the alliance. If a beastkin wished sabotage, they would not leave cartoonish runes.” His tail flicked with restrained irritation.

Elfiria’s voice cut through. “Agreed. We cannot fracture over pranks. Seris?”

Seris placed the prank rune stone on the table. “Illusions have been triggered across the keep. They carry the same ink as the rail sigils. Someone is testing how quickly we respond.”

The Aetherian envoy sighed. “So we have a joker stirring panic.”

Kael couldn’t help it. “At least they have taste—glitter is flattering.” The council snorted despite themselves. Humor broke tension.

Elfiria’s lips quirked. “We will escalate patrols quietly. Kael, Lyria, Rowan—trace the source of these runes. Seris, reinforce glide-rail wards.”

As they left, Darrum muttered, “If the demons attack, perhaps we shall distract them with confetti.”

Kael saluted with two fingers. “Confetti saves lives. Probably.”

Outside, Lyria elbowed him. “Nice comic relief.”

“Someone has to keep morale. Also, I hear demons fear glitter.”

Rowan shook his head, smiling. “You’re both impossible.”

### Quiet Confessions

Night draped Sunspoke in indigo. Lanterns floated above the courtyard, tethered by thin mana threads. Kael sat on the wall, legs dangling over the drop. The feather charm rested against his lips. He whispered, voice barely more than a breath.

“I don’t fear battle. I fear losing the laughter between us.” The charm warmed, recording.

Footsteps approached. Rowan perched beside him. “Practicing speeches?”

Kael pocketed the charm. “Maybe.”

Rowan glanced at the horizon where the Holy Dome’s faint glow met the dark Outlands. “War steals humor first. We should hoard it.”

Kael nudged Rowan’s shoulder. “I’ll keep cracking jokes if you keep sticking ribbons.”

“Deal.” Rowan’s eyes softened. “You were brave today. Not just flashy.”

Kael looked away, embarrassed. “Don’t start.”

Rowan grinned. “Relax. I like you better with glitter.”

A gust of wind brought Lyria’s laughter from below. Kael’s heart lifted. The sabotage was a warning, but tonight, humor and camaraderie held the shadows at bay.

### Closing Beat

As the trio retired, a figure cloaked in grey watched from the rafters of the glide-rail hub. A Veilborne agent, face hidden by a mask painted with a perpetual grin, traced a finger over a rune stone.

“Phase one, successful,” they whispered, voice full of mirth. “Let the glitter fall where it may.”

Far below, Kael drifted to sleep with the feather charm under his pillow, unaware that the confession it held would soon light brighter than any prankwright spark.
