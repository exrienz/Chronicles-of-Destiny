# World Settings - Chronicles of Destiny

## Overview
Mythosia is a realm of ten great kingdoms on the brink of a catastrophic war. Shadow agents manipulated the nations into conflict to fuel despair and grief—energies that enabled the resurrection of the Demon King and his seven generals. Five nations—Eldoria, Aetheria, Kharaz'Mar, Sylvanaria, and one unnamed desert ally—formed the Alliance of Light. Elfiria of Aetheria wields the Holy Dome, a divine barrier currently protecting Aetheria, Eldoria, Kharaz'Mar, and Sylvanaria. The barrier leaves the remaining kingdoms exposed to the demon horde.

## Timeline
- **Pre-Chapter 1:** Ten kingdoms spiral toward war due to shadow manipulation; Demon King resurrects with seven generals; Alliance of Light forms, led by Eldoria; their strongest hero falls; Elfiria deploys the Holy Dome, stopping the demon advance but only covering four kingdoms; demon forces target unprotected lands.
- **Chapter 1:** Kael Ardyn and Aster Veylan accompany Elfiria outside the Dome to remove a shadow artifact creating a tear; they fight shadowborn wights and retrieve the artifact. Kael's Resonant Steel exhibits resonance sensing. Shadow agent "Whisper" infiltrates near the river gate, plants and removes a second artifact, and mentions the Sanctum of Roots. Kael, Aster, and healer Lyria Rowan uncover a hidden undercity passage to the Sanctum, sensing activity and chanting within. Elfiria reveals the Sanctum is linked to the Demon King's resurrection and assigns Vanguard Team Three to investigate.

## Key Factions and Nations
- **Alliance of Light:** Eldoria (leader), Aetheria, Kharaz'Mar, Sylvanaria, and a desert ally; currently sheltering behind the Holy Dome.
- **Demon Legion:** Demon King and seven generals commanding hordes across the remaining kingdoms.
- **Shadow Agents:** Unknown manipulative force sowing discord to feed negative emotions; capable of planting shadow artifacts to disrupt the Dome; individual agent Whisper confirmed active.

## Characters

- **Aster Veylan** (Eldoria): Agile, irreverent trainee; dual-dagger fighter; loyal to Kael but questions authority. Assigned to Vanguard Team Three.
- **Lyria Rowan** (Eldoria): Healer-mage; knowledgeable about wards and resonance melodies; supports Kael and Aster on Vanguard Team Three.
- **Whisper** (Shadow agent): Silver-eyed infiltrator using shadow glyphs; aware of Sanctum of Roots and claims "the war was a lie"; sows doubt and manipulates Dome seams.
- **Mira Ardyn** (Eldoria): Kael's younger sister, stranded outside the Dome; current status unknown but motivates Kael.
- **Brann** (Kharaz'Mar dwarf): Armorer who provides Kael with a Mirrorlace cloak; believes steel remembers wielders.

## Locations
- **Holy Dome:** Protective barrier around key Alliance nations; has woven lattice seams vulnerable to shadow artifacts.
- **Eldoria Capital:** Vanguard training grounds, barracks, war room, and forges (including Brann's forge).
- **Ruined Watchtower (Outside Dome):** Site of first detected tear; shadowborn wights emerged here.
- **River Gate Mist Zone:** Location of second artifact planted by Whisper; contains hidden runic wall leading to undercity staircase.
- **Undercity Tunnels:** Ancient passages beneath Eldoria; contain warded runes and lead toward sealed chambers.
- **Sanctum of Roots:** Sealed temple beneath Eldoria; door of whitewood and iron covered in sigils requiring resonance and melody to open. Pulsing roots and distant chanting indicate renewed activity; tied to Demon King's resurrection.

## Magic, Technology, and Items
- **Holy Dome:** Ancient artifact emitting an unbreakable light barrier with limited range and woven lattice susceptible to disruption.
- **Resonant Steel:** Swords responsive to intent; can resonate with energies and read attack intent; capable of awakening with wielders. Kael's blade shows early awakening and visions connected to the Sanctum.
- **Echo Glyph:** Crystal shard tied to scabbards to record sensory data during missions.
- **Mirrorlace Cloak:** Light cloak woven to scramble shadow sight and muffle weapon resonance; issued to Kael.

## Unresolved Threads
- Identity and motives of the shadow agents, particularly Whisper.
- Fate of populations, including Mira, outside the Holy Dome.
- Full purpose of the Sanctum of Roots and how it ties to the Demon King's revival; meaning of the chanting and recent tremors.
- Possible leak within the Alliance regarding knowledge of the Sanctum.
- Whether Kael's resonance ability can fully awaken his sword and interface with the Sanctum's seal.
