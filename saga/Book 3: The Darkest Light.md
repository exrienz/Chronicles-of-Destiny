Three years after Fin, the heroine, succumbed to corruption, a new era of heroes dawned with the birth of Brynwell Windchaser. This promising hero-to-be entered the world in Aquilonia, on one of its secluded islands. Bryn's parents made every effort to shield him from the stigma associated with being a potential hero, as the demon army had taken to targeting individuals destined for heroic roles. He spent the early years of his life on this hidden isle, his "Hero" status kept a well-guarded secret.

However, when Bryn reached the age of ten, fate took an unexpected turn. The secrecy surrounding his identity was inadvertently shattered, exposing him to the world at large. In response, the demon king dispatched three of his most formidable generals with a single directive: track down Bryn and eliminate him. Just as the threat closed in and his parents teetered on the brink of death, their prayers were answered by a benevolent goddess.

In his darkest hour, Bryn found salvation in the form of Ignisar, the ancient dragon of balance. Ignisar engaged the trio of demon generals in a fierce battle, though not without incurring injuries himself. Likewise, the demon commanders suffered grievous wounds. Seizing an opportune moment, Ignisar seized Bryn and took flight from the tumultuous scene. Fuelled by rage, one of the demon generals, consumed by vengeful fury, laid waste to the island, annihilating Bryn's friends and kin. Helpless, Bryn watched through tears as his past was engulfed in flames.

Guiding Bryn to safety, Ignisar sought refuge in its hidden cavern. There, Bryn was shielded from the sinister clutches of the demon horde, safe within the sanctuary provided by the ancient dragon.
