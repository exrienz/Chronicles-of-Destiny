# Chapter 13: The Siege

## Prologue: The Shadow Below

*Location: The Crypts beneath the Fortress of Dawn*
*Time: Night*

The Crypts were silent, save for the dripping of water and the restless shuffling of the dead. It was a place where the air itself felt heavy, burdened by centuries of forgotten grief.

The Demon King had not bothered to clear the crypts. Why would he? The dead were his servants. He assumed they would rise to defend him if called upon. He did not anticipate that the living would walk among them.

But in the deepest level, a grate rusted shut for centuries began to groan.

*Creeeeak.*

It popped open with a sound like a snapping bone.

A massive hand reached out. Drakon pulled himself up, silent as a mountain can be, his scales scraping against the rough stone. He held his breath, scanning the darkness with eyes adapted to the deep earth.

"Clear," he whispered, his voice a low rumble.

Kaelen, Lyra, and Elfiria climbed out behind him. They were covered in slime from the maintenance shaft, smelling of stagnant water and rust.

"We are directly under the Throne Room," Elfiria whispered, checking her magical compass. The needle was spinning wildly, reacting to the massive concentrations of dark energy above. "The Weapon is in the adjacent chamber. The Hall of Heroes."

"Ironic," Lyra muttered, checking her daggers. "We're about to blow up the Hall of Heroes to become heroes."

## Part 1: The Infiltration

They moved through the crypts. The air was thick with decay. Statues of long-dead kings watched them from the shadows, their stone eyes seemingly judging the intruders.

"Patrol," Kaelen hissed.

They ducked behind a row of sarcophagi.

A group of skeletal warriors marched past. They clattered in the dark, their armor rusted, their eyes glowing with a pale, sickly green light. They were the Old Guard, raised from their rest to serve a new, darker master.

Kaelen used his *Intent Sensing*. He felt their mindless hunger, a static buzz in the back of his mind. They weren't looking for intruders; they were just patrolling a loop, trapped in a mockery of their former duty.

"Wait," he signaled with a hand.

The patrol passed, the sound of their bone-feet fading into the gloom.

"Go."

They moved fast and low. They reached the heavy iron doors of the Hall of Heroes. The doors were massive, embossed with the history of the Alliance.

"Locked," Lyra checked the mechanism. "Magically sealed. High-level warding."

"I can open it," Elfiria said, examining the runes. "But it's tied to the alarm system. As soon as I break the seal, they'll know."

"We don't have a choice," Kaelen said. He looked at his team. "This is it. Once we open this door, there's no going back."

"I am ready," Drakon hefted his shield.

"Let's make some noise," Lyra grinned, though her hands were shaking slightly.

"Do it," Kaelen nodded to Elfiria.

Elfiria placed her hands on the door. She chanted a word of power. *Dispel.*

The runes flared and died. The lock clicked. The doors swung open.

And the alarm sounded. A magically amplified scream that echoed through the entire fortress, shaking dust from the ceiling.

"Run!" Kaelen yelled.

They sprinted into the Hall. It was a massive circular room. In the center, a crystal sphere hovered above a pedestal, pulsing with a dormant, white light. The Starlight Weapon.

"That's it!" Elfiria ran to the sphere.

"They're coming!" Lyra shouted, looking back at the door.

From the shadows of the crypt, red eyes appeared. Dozens. Hundreds. The patrol had turned around. And they were bringing friends.

"Drakon! Block the door!"

"Shield Wall!" Drakon slammed his shield down. He activated the rune on the face. The shield expanded, creating a translucent barrier of force that filled the archway.

*THUD. THUD.*

The demons hammered against it. Claws, axes, and dark magic battered the barrier.

"Elfiria! How long?" Kaelen drew his *Twin Stars*. The blades hummed, sensing the proximity of the source.

"The sequence is complex!" she typed runes into the air, her fingers moving like a pianist playing a concerto. "The system is dormant! I have to bypass the safeties! Five minutes!"

"We buy her five minutes," Kaelen said. "Lyra, watch the vents. Drakon, hold the door."

"What about you?"

"I'll kill anything that gets through."

## Part 2: The Siege

*System Alert: Siege Mode Activated.*
*Wave 1: The Horde.*
*Time Remaining: 4:59.*

The door wouldn't hold forever. A massive Ogre, summoned by the noise, smashed a hole in the stone wall next to the door.

"Breach!" Drakon yelled.

Demons poured in through the hole. Ghouls, Imps, and Skeletal Warriors. A tide of teeth and claws.

Kaelen met them.

*Twin Stars* hummed. He was a whirlwind of light. He cut through the first wave like wheat. Every strike left a trail of white fire.

*Combo: 20x.*
*System Alert: Starlight Resonance Active. Damage +50%.*

"Back to the pit!" Kaelen shouted, spinning and decapitating two ghouls at once.

"Help!" Lyra screamed.

Gargoyles were dropping from the ceiling vents. Stone monsters with razor-sharp wings. Lyra was dodging, firing her crossbow, but she was cornered against a pillar.

Kaelen threw one of his swords. It spun through the air, a disc of light. It sliced the wing off a gargoyle mid-dive.

"Thanks!" Lyra gasped, finishing the creature with a dagger to the eye.

Kaelen caught his sword on the return arc. "Stay close!"

*Wave 2: The Elites.*
*Time Remaining: 2:30.*

The fodder was gone. Now the real threat arrived. Shadow Knights. Heavily armored, skilled, and intelligent.

Three of them charged Kaelen.

*Clang.*

Kaelen parried a heavy axe. The force rattled his teeth. He spun, stabbing the Knight in the throat. The *Starlight* burned the demon, turning the wound into white fire. The demon screamed as it dissolved.

"It works!" Kaelen laughed, the adrenaline flooding his system. "They burn! They really burn!"

But Drakon was struggling. His shield was cracking under the assault of a Void Mage.

"I cannot hold!" Drakon roared.

The barrier shattered. The door exploded inward.

And through the dust stepped a nightmare.

General Malakor.

"You again," Malakor growled. He looked around the room, seeing the pile of dead demons. He looked at the glowing sphere. "So this is your plan? A nightlight?"

"It's the sun, you idiot," Kaelen said, stepping between Malakor and Elfiria.

"Die," Malakor charged.

## Part 3: The Sacrifice

*System Alert: Raid Boss Encounter.*
*Target: Malakor (Phase 2).*
*Time Remaining: 0:45.*

Kaelen met him. This wasn't like before. Kaelen had the weapons. He had the skill. And he had nothing to lose.

He dodged Malakor's swing. He slashed the General's leg. *Burn.*

Malakor roared in pain. "You little rat!"

He swung his greatsword in a massive arc. Kaelen ducked, but the wind of the passing blade cut his cheek.

"Elfiria!" Kaelen shouted.

"Almost there!" she screamed. The sphere was glowing blindingly bright now. The room was filling with light. The shadows were retreating.

"No!" Malakor realized what was happening. "Destroy it!"

He ignored Kaelen. He summoned a massive ball of Hellfire in his hand.

"Burn it all!"

He threw the fireball at Elfiria and the sphere.

"No!" Kaelen realized the danger. If the fire hit the crystal while it was priming, it would destabilize. It wouldn't create a dome; it would create a crater.

He did the only thing he could. He jumped.

He threw himself into the path of the fireball.

"Shield!" Kaelen crossed his swords.

The Hellfire hit him.

It burned. It felt like his skin was melting. The heat was absolute. But the *Twin Stars* absorbed some of it, glowing red hot.

*System Alert: HP Critical.*
*Armor Destroyed.*
*Fire Resistance: Failed.*
*Status: Burning.*

Kaelen fell to the floor, smoke rising from his tunic. He couldn't move.

"Kaelen!" Elfiria screamed, tears streaming down her face.

"Finish it!" Kaelen wheezed.

Malakor laughed. He walked over to Kaelen, raising his sword for the final blow. "A noble sacrifice. Useless, but noble."

Elfiria slammed her hand onto the final rune.

"ACTIVATION!"

***

## Part 4: The Light

The sphere didn't just glow. It detonated.

A wave of pure, holy white light expanded from the center of the room. It moved faster than thought.

It hit Malakor.

He didn't even have time to scream. The light hit him, and he simply... ceased to be. His armor, his flesh, his very soul—erased from existence.

The light passed through Kaelen.

He flinched, expecting to be vaporized.

But it didn't burn. It felt cool. Like a summer breeze. It washed over him, soothing the burns, knitting the flesh. It filled his lungs with sweet air.

It passed through Drakon and Lyra, refreshing them, refilling their stamina.

It hit the walls. It passed through the stone as if it wasn't there.

Above, in the throne room, the Demon King Azezel looked down at the floor as it began to glow.

"Oh," Azezel said, a look of genuine surprise on his face.

The light erupted from the floor. The fortress disintegrated. The Demon King was blasted into the sky, his form scattering like smoke in a hurricane.

The light expanded outward. Mile after mile. It covered the Valley. It covered the pass. It stopped only when it reached the limit of the ley lines.

A Dome. A perfect, impenetrable Dome of Light.

***

## Part 5: The Choice

In the Hall of Heroes (or what was left of it—now an open-air platform in the center of a crater), the party stood up.

The sky above was blue. The dark clouds were gone, pushed back by the Dome. The sun—the real sun—shone down on them.

"We did it," Lyra whispered. She looked at her hands. "We're alive."

"Look," Elfiria pointed.

Outside the Dome, the darkness raged. They could see demons pressing against the light, burning like moths. But they couldn't get in.

"It's beautiful," Drakon said.

Kaelen looked at the map on his system.

"We saved the Inner Kingdoms," he said. "Eldoria is safe. Aetheria is safe."

But then he looked south.

Aridia. Kharaz'Mar. They were outside the Dome. The red stain of the Demon Army was gathering there.

"We locked them out," Elfiria realized with horror. "We saved ourselves. And left them to die."

"No," Kaelen said. "We bought them time. And now... we go help them."

"How?" Lyra asked. "We can't leave. The Dome blocks us too. It blocks anything with mana."

"The tunnels," Kaelen smiled. "The Custodian said the maintenance shaft goes both ways. We go under the wall."

"Into the fire?" Drakon asked. "Into the lands where the demons rule?"

"Into the fire," Kaelen confirmed. "We started this war. We're going to finish it."

He looked at his friends. They were battered, bruised, and exhausted. But they were standing.

"Are you with me?"

"Always," Lyra said.

"For the meat," Drakon grinned.

"For the world," Elfiria nodded.

They turned away from the safety of the light and headed back into the dark tunnels, walking towards the war that was waiting for them.

*System Alert: Chapter Completed.*
*World State Update: Holy Dome Active. Malakor Defeated (Again). Demon King Displaced.*
*Party Status: Victorious. Exiled.*
