# Chapter 13: The Siege

## Prologue: The Shadow Below

*Location: The Crypts beneath the Fortress of Dawn*
*Time: Night*

The Crypts were silent, save for the dripping of water and the restless shuffling of the dead.

The Demon King had not bothered to clear the crypts. Why would he? The dead were his servants.

But in the deepest level, a grate rusted shut for centuries began to groan.

*Creeeeak.*

It popped open.

A massive hand reached out. Drakon pulled himself up, silent as a mountain can be.

He scanned the room. "Clear."

Kaelen, Lyra, and Elfiria climbed out.

"We are directly under the Throne Room," Elfiria whispered, checking her magical compass. "The Weapon is in the adjacent chamber. The Hall of Heroes."

"Ironic," Lyra muttered.

## Part 1: The Infiltration

They moved through the crypts. The air was thick with decay.

"Patrol," Kaelen hissed.

They ducked behind a row of sarcophagi.

A group of skeletal warriors marched past. They clattered in the dark, their eyes glowing green.

Kaelen used his *Intent Sensing*. He felt their mindless hunger.

"Wait," he signaled.

The patrol passed.

"Go."

They reached the heavy iron doors of the Hall of Heroes.

"Locked," Lyra checked the mechanism. "Magically sealed."

"I can open it," Elfiria said. "But it will alert them."

"We don't have a choice," Kaelen said. "Do it."

Elfiria placed her hands on the door. *Dispel.*

The lock clicked. The doors swung open.

And the alarm sounded. A magically amplified scream that echoed through the entire fortress.

"Run!" Kaelen yelled.

They sprinted into the Hall. It was a massive circular room. In the center, a crystal sphere pulsed with dormant light.

"That's it!" Elfiria ran to the sphere.

"They're coming!" Lyra shouted, looking back at the door.

From the shadows of the crypt, red eyes appeared. Dozens. Hundreds.

"Drakon! Block the door!"

"Shield Wall!" Drakon slammed his shield down. It expanded, blocking the entrance.

*THUD. THUD.*

The demons hammered against it.

"Elfiria! How long?" Kaelen drew his *Twin Stars*.

"The sequence is complex!" she typed runes into the air. "Five minutes!"

"We buy her five minutes," Kaelen said. "Lyra, watch the vents. Drakon, hold the door."

"What about you?"

"I'll kill anything that gets through."

***

## Part 2: The Last Stand

*System Alert: Siege Mode Activated.*
*Wave 1: Ghouls.*
*Time Remaining: 4:59.*

The door wouldn't hold forever. A massive Ogre smashed a hole in the stone wall next to the door.

"Breach!" Drakon yelled.

Demons poured in.

Kaelen met them.

*Twin Stars* hummed. He was a whirlwind of light. He cut through the first wave—imps and ghouls—like wheat.

*Combo: 20x.*
*System Alert: Starlight Resonance Active.*

But then the elites came. Shadow Knights.

*Clang.*

Kaelen parried a heavy axe. The force rattled his teeth. He spun, stabbing the Knight in the throat. The *Starlight* burned the demon, turning the wound into white fire.

"It works!" Kaelen laughed. "They burn!"

"Help!" Lyra screamed.

Gargoyles were dropping from the ceiling vents. Lyra was dodging, firing her crossbow, but she was cornered.

Kaelen threw one of his swords. It spun through the air, slicing the wing off a gargoyle.

"Thanks!" Lyra gasped.

"Two minutes!" Elfiria shouted. The sphere was glowing brighter. The room was filling with light.

"They sense it!" Kaelen yelled. "They know what it is!"

The demons went into a frenzy. They threw themselves at the defenders with suicidal abandon.

Drakon's shield cracked. "I cannot hold them!"

The wall exploded. A massive shape stepped through.

General Malakor.

"You again," Malakor growled. He looked at the glowing sphere. "So this is your plan? A nightlight?"

"It's the sun, you idiot," Kaelen said, catching his returned sword.

"Die," Malakor charged.

***

## Part 3: The Sacrifice

Kaelen met him. This wasn't like before. Kaelen had the weapons. He had the skill.

He dodged Malakor's swing. He slashed the General's leg. *Burn.*

Malakor roared. "You little rat!"

He summoned Hellfire.

"No!" Elfiria shouted. "The sphere! The fire will destabilize it!"

Kaelen realized the danger. If the fire hit the crystal, it would explode.

He did the only thing he could. He jumped in front of the sphere.

"Shield!" Kaelen crossed his swords.

The Hellfire hit him.

It burned. It felt like his skin was melting. But the *Twin Stars* absorbed some of it.

*System Alert: HP Critical. Armor Destroyed. Resistance Failed.*

Kaelen fell, smoking.

"Kaelen!" Elfiria screamed.

"Finish it!" Kaelen wheezed.

Malakor raised his sword to finish Kaelen.

Elfiria slammed the final rune.

"ACTIVATION!"

***

## Part 4: The Light

The sphere didn't just glow. It detonated.

A wave of pure, holy white light expanded from the center of the room.

It hit Malakor. He didn't even have time to scream. He was vaporized. His armor, his flesh, his very soul—erased.

The light passed through Kaelen. It didn't burn. It felt cool. It healed his burns. It knit his flesh.

It passed through Drakon and Lyra, refreshing them.

It hit the walls. It passed through the stone as if it wasn't there.

Above, in the throne room, the Demon King looked down.

"Oh," Azezel said.

The light erupted from the floor. The fortress disintegrated. The Demon King was blasted into the sky, his form scattering like smoke.

The light expanded outward. Mile after mile. It covered the Valley. It covered the pass. It stopped only when it reached the limit of the ley lines.

A Dome. A perfect, impenetrable Dome of Light.

***

## Part 5: The Silence

In the Hall of Heroes (or what was left of it—now an open-air platform in the center of a crater), the party stood up.

The sky above was blue. The dark clouds were gone, pushed back by the Dome.

"We did it," Lyra whispered. She looked at her hands. "We're alive."

"Look," Elfiria pointed.

Outside the Dome, the darkness raged. They could see demons pressing against the light, burning. But they couldn't get in.

"It's beautiful," Drakon said.

Kaelen looked at the map on his system.

"We saved the Inner Kingdoms," he said. "But look."

He pointed south.

Aridia. Kharaz'Mar. They were outside the Dome.

"We locked them out," Elfiria realized with horror. "We saved ourselves. And left them to die."

"No," Kaelen said. "We bought them time. And now... we go help them."

"How?" Lyra asked. "We can't leave. The Dome blocks us too."

"The tunnels," Kaelen smiled. "The Custodian said the maintenance shaft goes both ways. We go under the wall."

"Into the fire?" Drakon asked.

"Into the fire," Kaelen confirmed.

They turned away from the safety of the light and headed back into the dark tunnels.

*System Alert: Chapter Completed.*
*World State Update: Holy Dome Active. Malakor Defeated (Again). Demon King Displaced.*
*Party Status: Victorious.*
