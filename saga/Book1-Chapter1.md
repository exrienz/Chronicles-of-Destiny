# Book 1 - Chapter 1: Awakening in the Shattered Dawn

I opened my eyes to the trembling hum of the Holy Dome.

The barrier's faint blue light always woke me before dawn, as if it were whispering the number of days since Eldoria began hiding behind luminous walls. Today, that whisper felt heavier, as though the Dome itself knew something had shifted in the world beyond the light. I lay on my back in the barracks, staring at the ceiling beams of polished whitewood, listening to the steady breathing of the other trainee knights around me. Every inhale and exhale sounded like a countdown.

*Two hundred and thirteen days since the Demon King returned.*

*One hundred and eighty-four since the Alliance retreated behind the Dome.*

*Three since I received the summoning scroll bearing Elfiria's crest.*

Numbers had become their own kind of prayer, a ritual to keep memory from crumbling under fear. But today, math wasn't enough. There was motion in the air, a scent of steel and ozone that didn't belong inside these walls.

"Kael, you're awake already?" Aster's whisper cut through the stillness. His bunk was above mine, and he hung his head upside down, messy auburn hair dangling like a curtain. "Thought you'd try to sleep through the last day of freedom."

"Freedom?" I pushed myself upright. "We march tomorrow."

"Exactly," he said, grinning. "Nothing tastes sweeter than the night before a battle you haven't lost yet." He flipped to the ground with a catlike twist that would have made the instructors scowl if they were present. "Besides, Commander Elfiria wants us on the sky parapet before sunrise. Top secret, she said." He emphasized the last two words like a storyteller hinting at buried treasure.

Top secret? The last time that phrase was thrown around, the Alliance pushed the Dome outward by thirty paces—a minor miracle that saved two villages. But it also burned Elfiria for a week, her hands wrapped in bandages so tight she couldn't lift her own teacup.

I slid my feet into leather boots and tightened the straps of my light harness. My sword—an unadorned training blade—lay beside the bunk. I held it for a moment, letting my fingers trace the notches on its guard. Each nick marked a sparring lesson, a bruise, a vow.

*Today, I'm supposed to earn a real weapon.*

We slipped out of the barracks and into the cold pre-dawn. The Holy Dome, a translucent hemisphere of light, painted the world with a perpetual twilight. Beyond the barrier, distant mountains stood as silhouettes, serrated teeth against a watercolor sky. Inside, Eldoria's capital still slept; streetlamps glowed faintly, their flames muffled by the Dome's soft shimmer.

Aster and I climbed the narrow stairs that coiled up the inner wall of the fort. The parapet, known as the sky parapet because it reached just beneath the Dome's arc, was quiet but for the flapping banners of Eldoria. Gold threads caught the light, weaving the crest of a rising phoenix across crimson silk.

Commander Elfiria stood near the edge, her silver hair braided tightly and pinned beneath a ceremonial circlet. Her eyes, cool and assessing, swept across us the moment our boots hit stone.

"You arrived before the sun," she said. Her voice carried like a clear bell, the Dome's hum fading under its strength. "Good. Kael, Aster—you two will accompany me beyond the barrier today."

The words struck like a blade to the ribs. "Beyond?" I repeated, unable to mask the shock. "Commander, the Dome—"

"Will lift for seven minutes," she said. "We need scouts who know how to move quickly and see clearly. You both ranked first in agility tests for your cohort." She paused, letting that sink in. "We have located a tear in the eastern weave of the Dome, caused by a shadow artifact that lodged itself in the light. If unremoved, the tear will widen and invite a demon incursion."

Aster's grin faded. "Shadow agents? Here?"

"We believe so." Elfiria turned her gaze to the east. The dawn painted her profile in bronze. "This is the first time we've detected their presence since the war halted. That means the Demon Legion is probing, looking for a way past us. We will not give it to them." She extended her hand. A knight approached carrying two bundled cloths. "Kael, Aster—your provisional weapons." The knight unfurled the cloth, revealing paired arming swords with midnight-blue fuller lines and simple, unadorned hilts. Yet when I grasped mine, a pulse ran up my arm, as if the steel recognized me.

"This blade is called a Resonant Steel," Elfiria explained. "It responds to your intent. In time, its spirit may awaken. For now, keep your focus and it will match you." She nodded toward the inner stairs. "We meet at the eastern gate. Ten minutes." She looked at me directly. "Kael—there is more. Your summoning scroll also contained this." From her belt pouch, she drew a small crystal shard mounted on a leather cord. "An Echo Glyph. Tie it to your scabbard. It will record everything you perceive today."

I fastened the glyph, my heartbeat matching the Dome's steady thrumming. Beyond the barrier lay the lands I was born in—the villages we abandoned when the Alliance fell back. *What will I see after all these months? Ashes? Survivors?*

"Commander," I said, forcing my voice to stay level. "Why us? We're fresh trainees."

"Because fresh eyes notice what veterans dismiss," she replied. "And because the Dome trusts you."

The eastern gate opened with a sound like a hundred chimes. For a breath, the Dome thinned into ribbons of light, parting enough to let us pass. Cold air rushed in, smelling of pine and something darker—a coppery tang that prickled my skin.

Outside, the world looked...drained. Grass once emerald now lay in hues of washed-out gray. Trees retained their shapes, but their leaves had lost luster. The sky, free of the Dome's shimmer, stretched wide and harsh.

"Seven minutes," Elfiria murmured. "Stay close." The three of us moved as one, boots muffled by damp earth. Aster's steps were a tad too light, excitement tempered by fear. I kept my hand on my sword, feeling the Resonant Steel's subtle warmth.

We found the tear by the ruin of an old watchtower. The light of the Dome, from this side, appeared like countless threads woven together. Near the tower, strands frayed, leaving a gap the width of a palm. I knelt and saw it: a twisted metal spike lodged between the woven light, pulsing with violet haze.

"Shadow artifact," Elfiria said. She knelt beside me, fingers hovering above it. "It's disrupting the lattice. Kael, your perception affinity is high. Tell me what you see when you focus."

I drew a slow breath, letting the world narrow to the shimmer. The glyph at my scabbard warmed. Lines of pale light traced from the spike into the ground, worming toward the watchtower's foundation. Beyond, the earth trembled—faint vibrations, like footsteps.

"There's movement underground," I whispered. "At least three...no, four pulses. They feel like—"

The ground cracked open. Clawed hands burst from the soil, followed by bodies covered in black chitin. Shadowborn wights—creatures of grief condensed into form—clawed their way out, eyes glowing cobalt.

"Form up!" Elfiria commanded. "Kael, left! Aster, right!" She slammed her palm against the Dome's lattice. The light obeyed, bending into a translucent blade that she wielded one-handed.

I moved on instinct. The Resonant Steel sang, its hum syncing with the glyph. The first wight leaped; I sidestepped, dragging my blade in a crescent. The steel rang out, its resonance slicing through the creature's torso. It dissolved into ash, leaving a chill behind.

Aster's laughter, strained but genuine, echoed nearby. "Feels different when it's not training dummies!" He spun, twin daggers flashing, carving through a second wight.

Elfiria parried a slash meant for me, her light blade cracking the chitin of a third creature. "Focus on their cores!" she called. "Behind the sternum!"

The fourth wight lunged straight for me. I stepped forward instead of back, meeting it head-on. Its claws raked my shoulder guard, sparks flying. Pain flared, but I shoved it aside, thrusting toward its chest. The Resonant Steel vibrated, a harmonic tremor that seemed to pierce the wight's core. The creature shrieked and burst into smoke.

"Three minutes!" Aster shouted, glancing skyward. The Dome's threads quivered, struggling to remain parted.

"Kael, pull the artifact," Elfiria ordered. She held the last wight at bay, light blade locking with chitinous claws.

I grabbed the metal spike. It burned cold, biting into my palm. For a moment, voices whispered—fragmented, sorrowful.

*We failed. We fell.*

*The war was a lie.*

I grit my teeth and yanked. The spike tore free, and the gap began to knit. I hurled the artifact to the ground. Elfiria slammed her foot on it, shattering it with a burst of light. The remaining wight disintegrated, its energy dispersing into the morning air.

"Back inside!" Elfiria commanded. We sprinted, the Dome's threads already solidifying. I felt the barrier brush my shoulders as we dove through. The chime of light closing behind us echoed down the corridor.

Back on the safe side, my heart pounded against my ribs. My shoulder throbbed, blood seeping through leather. Aster braced his hands on his knees, breath hitching.

Elfiria examined the wound with quick efficiency. "Surface cut," she said. "You'll live." Her gaze, however, held an unspoken question. "What did the whispers say, Kael?"

I hesitated. "They...said the war was a lie. That they fell believing something false."

Elfiria's brow furrowed. "Shadow agents thrive on half-truths. We'll dissect this later." She pressed two fingers to the glyph on my scabbard. "This recorded everything. Good."

She straightened. "Report to the war room after medical. Today, you become provisional members of the Vanguard." Her tone softened, barely. "Good work. We needed confirmation of infiltration. Now we can counter."

*Provisional members?* My stomach flipped. The Vanguard were elite strike teams; trainees didn't leap to their ranks overnight.

Aster elbowed me. "Guess we just skipped a few steps."

"Steps paved with wight claws," I muttered.

---

The infirmary smelled of antiseptic herbs and clean linen. A healer stitched my shoulder while I tried not to flinch. Sunlight filtered through stained glass, painting the room in a kaleidoscope of colors. Outside, I heard the distant clang of practice weapons and the murmur of soldiers being briefed.

"You were outside," the healer, a young mage named Lyria, said as she tied the final knot. Her green eyes shone with curiosity. "How was it?"

"Gray," I answered. "Like someone drained the world of color."

She hummed. "My brother says the grief there sticks to your clothes. Did you feel any different?"

I thought of the whispers. "Maybe. The air is heavier. But it might just be knowing what's happened." I stood, rolling my shoulder experimentally. The stitches held, tight but flexible.

Lyria handed me a small vial of shimmering blue liquid. "Take this if the wound flares. And Kael—be careful. You're carrying a lot of people's hope." She smiled, but worry lingered in her gaze.

The war room lay beneath the central spire, a stone chamber ringed by banners and maps. A massive table occupied the center, its surface carved with topography. A projection of the Dome hovered above it, shifting as a translucent model. Elfiria stood at the head, flanked by generals from Eldoria, Kharaz'Mar, and Sylvanaria. Aster stood at my side, his expression uncharacteristically serious.

"The shadow artifact confirms our fears," Elfiria said, addressing the gathered leaders. "The shadow agents are testing the Dome for weaknesses. We removed the spike, but others may be embedded elsewhere. We need eyes on every inch." She gestured to me. "Kael sensed four wights before they emerged. His perception is unique."

A general with a braided beard—Marshal Garron of Kharaz'Mar—grunted approval. "We could use that sense to sweep the perimeter."

Elfiria nodded. "I'm assigning Kael and Aster to Vanguard Team Three under my direct supervision. Their first task: reconnaissance of all known structural seams in the Dome."

A murmur rippled through the room. Assigning trainees to a Vanguard team was unheard of. I swallowed, forcing myself to stand straight.

Elfiria's gaze found mine. "Kael. I also felt something when you pulled the artifact. Your sword...shifted."

I looked down. The Resonant Steel, now sheathed, felt warmer. "It hummed," I said. "Like it was resonating with the artifact's energy." I hesitated, then added, "When I struck the wight, the blade vibrated differently."

"The glyph recorded your swings," Elfiria said. "We'll analyze the resonance patterns. It may be the start of an awakening."

An awakening. Weapons in Mythosia could awaken, gaining spirits that bonded with wielders. It was rare, unpredictable, often triggered by intense experiences. I was a trainee—awakening a blade this soon bordered on myth.

The meeting moved to logistics. Patrols would double. Mages would tune the Dome's weave. And I? I was now bound to a path I hadn't imagined when I joined the academy to avoid my family's farm.

---

Later, in the courtyard, Aster sprawled on the grass, staring up at the Dome's curve. "Vanguard," he said, the word tasting strange in his mouth. "Think they'll give us cloaks?"

I lay beside him, letting the cool blades of grass prick my palms. "You'd pick the cloak over the title?"

"Cloaks are dramatic," he replied. "Imagine the wind catching them as we sprint across rooftops."

"We're scouting seams in the Dome, not starring in epic ballads." I closed my eyes. "Though a cloak might help hide the shaking in my legs."

Aster snorted. "I saw you out there. No shaking."

"Only because my hands were too busy holding a sword." My tone softened. "Aster, did you hear anything? When the artifact was in the lattice."

He shook his head. "Just the hum of the Dome. Why?"

"It whispered to me. Said the war was a lie." Saying it aloud made the words heavier. "Feels like a trap."

Aster sat up, expression serious. "Then we find the truth. And we don't die before we can tell anyone." He grinned, but it didn't reach his eyes.

---

*Training montage—day two as Vanguard provisional.*

Elfiria didn't give us cloaks. She gave us a schedule that made sleep a negotiable luxury. Dawn to noon: perimeter sweeps of the Dome, using the Resonant Steel and my perception to detect anomalies. Noon to dusk: combat drills under Garron's unforgiving watch. Night: resonance meditation with Elfiria, learning to listen to the blade's hum.

In one drill, Garron paired me against a veteran. "Read his movement," he growled. "Hear his intent."

The veteran lunged. I raised my blade—and felt a ripple of vibration through the Resonant Steel, a high tone when the strike was true, a low hum when it was feint. I adjusted. Parry high, step left, counter cut to his exposed flank. The veteran's eyes widened as my blade stopped an inch from his ribs.

"Again," Garron barked. We repeated until my arms burned. Each time, the resonance grew clearer. I was learning to read intent through sound.

At night, Elfiria taught us a breathing pattern called *Echo Alignment.* "Resonance isn't just sound," she said. "It's connection. Every element has a frequency. If you align, you can borrow strength." She placed her hand on my sword, eyes closing. The blade thrummed, and for a heartbeat, I felt her heartbeat through it. It was unsettling—and exhilarating.

"The blade is curious about you," she said after one session. "It wants to know your resolve."

"My resolve?" I echoed. "To protect the Dome?"

She shook her head. "That's duty. What's your core?"

I thought of the village beyond the barrier, of the younger sister I'd left behind when the retreat order came. Mira. Twelve years old, stubborn, eyes like the summer sky. "My family," I said softly. "Mira. I need to know if she survived."

Elfiria's gaze softened. "Then let that anchor you. Resonance responds to honesty."

---

On the fifth day, we detected a second tear. It hid near the river gate, where mist clung to the ground. My perception tingled as I approached, the glyph warming. "There's something here," I whispered.

Aster crouched, sweeping his dagger through the mist. The Dome's threads were intact to the eye, but when I held my blade near, it vibrated discordantly.

"Artifact is small," I murmured. "Maybe embedded in the stone."

"Or invisible," Aster added. "Shadow agents love tricks."

We were not alone. A flicker of motion near the river's edge caught my eye. A figure cloaked in black, hood low, fingers weaving patterns in the air. A shadow agent—human, not wight. My breath froze.

"Elfiria!" Aster whispered into his comm-shell, a small conch that carried voices along the Dome's frequencies. "We have visual."

"Hold position," her voice crackled back. "Do not engage until I arrive."

But the agent turned, sensing us. Our eyes met through the mist. His irises were silver, unsettling. He smiled.

"Curious little sparks," he said, voice silky. "You can hear the Dome sing, can't you?"

Aster raised his daggers. "Identify yourself!"

"Names are chains," the agent replied. "But you may call me Whisper." He flicked his fingers. The ground beneath the Dome's seam quivered. A black needle emerged, embedding itself in the light.

My blade screamed. Pain lanced through my arm, echoing up to my shoulder. I dropped to one knee.

"Kael!" Aster lunged, but Whisper gestured, and a wall of darkness surged up, separating us.

The Dome flickered. "Elfiria, now!" I shouted. The comm-shell hissed; interference warped her response.

Whisper walked toward me, boots silent. "You heard the lie, didn't you? The war was a lie. Ask your commanders why the Demon King truly rose." His smile widened. "Ask about the Sanctum of Roots."

I gripped my blade despite the pain. "Why tell me?"

"Because resonance only obeys those who question." His hand brushed the black needle. The blade's scream intensified, then abruptly ceased. The needle dissolved into smoke. "Consider this an overture." He turned to leave.

"Stop!" Aster's shout came from beyond the wall. He emerged, blades ready—but Whisper was gone, mist swirling where he had stood.

Elfiria arrived seconds later, light-blade drawn. "Report!"

I relayed the encounter, hands still trembling. Elfiria's jaw tightened. "Sanctum of Roots," she murmured. "He shouldn't know about that." She looked at me sharply. "Did he say anything else?"

"That the war was a lie," I said. "Again. And that we should ask you why the Demon King rose."

Silence. The Dome hummed, almost accusing.

"We seal this area," Elfiria said finally. "Double patrols. Kael, Aster, you're off duty for now. Write everything you remember."

---

That night, sleep eluded me. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Whisper's silver eyes, heard the blade's scream. The words *Sanctum of Roots* carved themselves into my thoughts.

The Sanctum. A forbidden temple buried beneath Eldoria's oldest tree. Legends said it held a conduit to the world's lifeforce. If Whisper knew of it, did the shadow agents seek it? And what did that have to do with the Demon King?

I slipped from my bunk and walked to the armory's rooftop. The Dome above shimmered, stars faint beyond its veil. I drew the Resonant Steel, letting the night air cool the metal. "What are you trying to tell me?" I whispered to the blade.

It hummed, soft, like a heart beating. For a heartbeat, an image flashed in my mind—not my own memory. A towering tree with roots glowing pale green, reaching into an underground cavern. Voices chanting. A circle of light twisting, breaking. A shadow emerging.

I staggered. "You saw it," I breathed. "You were there? Or you remember?"

The blade's hum faded. But the impression remained: the Sanctum of Roots was tied to the Demon King's resurrection.

"Kael?" A soft voice. Lyria stood behind me, a cloak wrapped around her shoulders. "Couldn't sleep?"

"Something like that," I said, sheathing the sword. "Lyria...do you know anything about the Sanctum of Roots?"

She frowned. "Old myths. My grandmother told stories. A place where the world tree's roots met the sky's reflection. Eldoria sealed it centuries ago. Why?"

"A shadow agent mentioned it. He implied...we're missing pieces about the Demon King's rise." I exhaled, breath fogging. "Elfiria knew the name."

Lyria's eyes widened. "That's above my rank. But secrets fester, Kael. If the Sanctum has answers, they'll be buried deep."

We stood in silence, watching the Dome ripple. Somewhere beyond, Mira might still be alive. Somewhere beneath our feet, a sealed temple held truths we weren't meant to touch.

*Resonance only obeys those who question.*

I promised myself then: I'd find the Sanctum. Not just to satisfy Whisper, but to uncover why we were truly fighting.

---

The next day, the Vanguard assembled in a training hall illuminated by sunbeams filtered through the Dome. Elfiria addressed us, voice firm. "An unknown agent breached the outer mists. We cannot rely solely on the Dome. We'll split into pairs and sweep the undercity tunnels for any trace of shadow glyphs. Kael, Aster—you'll take Lyria."

Lyria blinked. "Me?"

"Your healing magic will be needed," Elfiria said. "And your knowledge of old wards."

We descended into the undercity—stone tunnels winding beneath Eldoria, relics of old aqueducts and forgotten cellars. The air was cool and damp. Our footsteps echoed.

I let my senses stretch. The Resonant Steel hummed softly, guiding me like a divining rod. At a junction, the hum sharpened. "Here," I said.

A wall section glowed faintly, runes etched into the stone. Lyria traced them with her fingers. "These are old ward marks. They keep roots from breaking the masonry." She paused. "Roots. Sanctum."

Aster whistled low. "We really are going underground." He tapped the wall. "Think there's a passage?"

"The resonance is strongest here," I said. "Maybe a hidden mechanism." I pressed my hand against the stone. The blade vibrated in my other hand, a low growl.

Lyria closed her eyes. "There's energy behind this. A ward linked to a key...a melody." She hummed a note. The runes brightened. She adjusted, humming higher, lower, until the vibration matched the blade's resonance.

The wall shifted. Stones slid aside, revealing a narrow staircase spiraling downward into darkness.

"We found a way," Aster said softly. "Elfiria will want to know."

"We tell her," I agreed, "but we also see what's down there."

"Kael," Lyria warned. "Protocol—"

"Protocol didn't stop Whisper," I said. "We need to know what's under our feet."

Aster sighed. "We're already in trouble. Might as well gather evidence." He grinned faintly. "Besides, I'm curious."

We descended carefully. The air grew colder. Roots protruded from the walls, pulsing with faint green light. The staircase opened into a cavern—a vast underground hollow dominated by a colossal root twisting from ceiling to floor, glowing with inner luminescence.

At its base stood a sealed door of whitewood and iron, covered in sigils. The air vibrated with raw power. My blade hummed louder, matching the root's frequency.

"The Sanctum," Lyria whispered. Reverence tinged her voice.

We approached the door. In its center, a circular indentation matched the size of a palm. Around it, the sigils glowed when the blade drew near.

"It wants a key," Aster said. "Or a resonance."

I placed my hand on the indentation. The blade vibrated violently, sending shockwaves up my arm. Pain lanced my shoulder, stitches tightening. I gritted my teeth, pushing through. The sigils flared, then dimmed.

"Not enough," Lyria said. "It needs more—either power or the correct frequency." She looked at my shoulder. "You're bleeding."

Blood seeped through the stitches. I stepped back. "We know where it is. We can come back prepared." I exhaled, arm trembling. "We should report."

"Agreed," Aster said. "Elfiria will want to throw us in a cell and then give us medals." He gave a weak laugh. "In that order."

As we turned to leave, the ground trembled. A low rumble echoed through the cavern. The root's glow pulsed faster.

"Kael!" Lyria grabbed my arm. The blade hummed again—not warning, but urgency. "Something's waking up."

A fissure opened in the cavern wall, and cold wind rushed through, carrying the distant sound of chanting. Voices. Ancient, layered, in a language I didn't know—but the resonance thrummed in my bones, demanding attention.

"We have to go," Aster insisted. "Now."

We fled up the stairs, sealing the wall behind us. The runes dimmed as the mechanism reset, leaving no sign of the hidden path. My heart hammered, not from exertion, but from the realization: the Sanctum wasn't dormant. It was stirring.

---

Elfiria's fury was cold and controlled. "You entered a sealed area without authorization," she said, voice like ice. "Do you understand the risk?"

"Yes," I said. My voice didn't waver. "But we found the Sanctum of Roots. It's not dormant. Something inside is active. And Whisper knew about it."

Silence hung heavy. The other generals exchanged glances.

Elfiria sighed, tension easing slightly. "Your recklessness could have triggered wards older than our alliance. But you also found what we've been guarding for generations." She looked at me. "The Sanctum is the reason the Demon King returned."

My breath caught. "What?"

"Centuries ago, the Sanctum was a conduit of primordial energy. The Alliance of that era sealed it, fearing corruption. The shadow agents seek to unseal it to feed the Demon King. When the war began, they manipulated nations to generate enough despair to crack the seal. They succeeded. The Demon King's resurrection was not an accident."

"Then why didn't we know?" Aster demanded. "Why did soldiers die without being told what we were protecting?"

"Because knowledge cuts both ways," Elfiria said. "The fewer who know, the fewer who can be coerced or deceived. But Whisper has already breached that barrier. We can no longer afford ignorance."

She stood, regal and resolute. "Kael, Aster, Lyria: you have forced my hand. Vanguard Team Three will lead the investigation into the Sanctum. We will reinforce the seal, discover who among us leaks information, and stop the shadow agents from using it again." She paused. "Kael, your resonance with the Sanctum may be key."

My shoulder ached, but a new fire lit within. "Then we start now."

"Rest first," Elfiria said. "We need your strength. Tomorrow, we descend with a full team." Her gaze softened. "Your sister lives outside the Dome, doesn't she?"

My heart clenched. "Yes."

"Then we fight not just for strategy, but for them." She looked around the room. "For every life beyond these walls."

As the meeting adjourned, Whisper's words echoed in my mind. *Resonance only obeys those who question.* We had begun to ask. The answers led straight to the roots of the world—and the truth behind the Demon King's rise.

Outside, the Holy Dome hummed, no longer a distant whisper but a living pulse. The Shattered Dawn had broken. The path ahead promised revelations and danger in equal measure.

And somewhere in the gray world beyond the light, Mira was waiting.

As dusk deepened, I slipped away to the weapons forge. The armorer, a grizzled dwarf named Brann, eyed me as I entered. "Vanguard pup," he grunted. "Word is you poked the roots of the world." He gestured to a rack of cloaks. "Take one. Mirrorlace weave. Won't stop a blade, but it'll scramble shadow sight." He tossed the cloak; it shimmered like liquid glass before settling on my shoulders, cool and weightless.

"Why give me this?" I asked.

"Because Elfiria told me to," Brann said, beard twitching. "And because your sword sings loud enough to wake the anvils. Keep it covered until you need the noise." He leaned closer. "And kid—steel remembers. Treat it right."

I left the forge with the Mirrorlace cloak wrapped tight. Its texture muffled the hum of the Resonant Steel, allowing my thoughts to finally quiet. I wandered toward the observation deck on the spire's mid-level. From there, I could see beyond the Dome, across the gray plains. In the distance, tiny embers dotted the horizon—campfires? Survivors? Or demon watch posts?

*Hold on, Mira,* I thought. *If you're out there, see this light. We'll widen it.*

Footsteps approached. Aster joined me, chewing on a strip of dried meat. "You got a cloak," he noted, eyes widening. "Unfair."

"Brann said it scrambles shadow sight," I said. "Want half?"

"Nah," he said, waving it off. "I'd just trip over it. Besides, I have my charm." He held up a string of wooden beads. "From my little sister. Said it keeps nightmares away." His grin softened. "Guess we both have people waiting."

We stood in companionable silence, watching the stars flicker beyond the Dome's veil. Somewhere below, Lyria's healing wards pulsed softly, and Elfiria's voice echoed in the command chamber. Plans were being forged, strategies drawn. But for a moment, the world narrowed to two friends and the hum of a barrier between them and the dark.

"Tomorrow," Aster said, breaking the quiet. "We face ancient doors and angry commanders."

"Tomorrow," I agreed, tightening the Mirrorlace cloak. "We make the Dome hum in a new key."

The night wind brushed past, carrying the faint scent of pine and distant smoke. My sword's resonance joined the Dome's, a subtle harmony that promised conflict and discovery. The cliffhanger hung over us like the stars—a question waiting for an answer.
