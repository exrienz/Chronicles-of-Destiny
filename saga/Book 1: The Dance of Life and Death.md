## Humor, Romance, and Erotic Placement
- **Humor**: Every council or investigative scene includes banter and Prankwright illusions. Battle aftermaths feature gear mishaps (e.g., glitter shields).
- **Romance**: Kael/Lyria rivalry blossoming; Kael/Rowan trust; Seris/Elfiria quiet longing. Aerial dances and collaborative magic are primary sparks.
- **Erotic Elements**: Centered on consensual mana-sharing rituals in Chapters 3, 4 (tension), 9 (consummation for Kael/Lyria), and 14 (intimate breathing for Rowan/Kael).

## Perspective Strategy
- Rotate POV between Kael, Lyria, Rowan, and Seris to balance action, intrigue, and emotional depth.
- Insert short antagonist POVs (Myrka, Whisper) to foreshadow threats and comedic villain asides.

## Continuity Notes
- Maintain Holy Dome limitations: protects alliance cores but not Outlands.
- Track glide-rail damage and repairs across chapters.
- Carry forward trinket exchanges and scents tied to mana-sharing rituals.
