# Chapter 9: The Mightiest Hero

## Prologue: The Sword Saint

*Location: The King's Road, heading towards the Valley*
*Time: Dawn, Two Days after the Attack*

Aric did not ride a horse. He walked. Yet, he moved faster than the column of cavalry behind him. Each step was a measured, precise movement that covered yards of ground.

He wore the armor of the Golden Paladins, but he carried no shield. He needed no shield. On his back was *Dawnbringer*, a sword forged from a fallen star.

"Lord Aric!" a messenger rode up, panting. "Report from the forward scouts! The Alliance camp... it is gone. Burned."

Aric didn't stop. "Survivors?"

"A few hundred. Huddled in the Fortress of Dawn. They say... they say a Demon General is there."

Aric stopped. The air around him grew heavy. The grass at his feet rippled as if in a wind, though the air was still.

"Malakor," Aric whispered the name.

He turned to the messenger. "Tell the men to double time. I am going ahead."

"Sir? It is fifty miles!"

Aric smiled. It was a dazzling, confident smile that made the messenger feel like everything was going to be alright.

"Then I shall run," Aric said.

He vanished in a blur of golden light.

## Part 1: The Fortress of Despair

*Location: Fortress of Dawn*
*Time: Mid-Day*

The Fortress of Dawn was a misnomer. It was currently the Fortress of Despair.

Inside the crumbling walls, the remnants of the Alliance army were huddled. The wounded groaned in the courtyard. The able-bodied stared at the walls, waiting for the end.

Kaelen sat on a crate, sharpening a sword he had looted from a dead guard. His own blades were broken.

"This is pointless," Lyra said. She was checking her poison vials. "Empty. Empty. Also empty. I can throw sand at them?"

"We hold the gate," Kaelen said. "That's the plan."

"Against an army?" Drakon asked. He was eating a wheel of cheese he had found. "I am strong, Kaelen. But there are thousands of them."

"We just need to hold until reinforcements arrive," Elfiria said. She was healing a soldier, her hands glowing faintly. Her mana was dangerously low.

"Reinforcements aren't coming," a soldier muttered. "We're dead."

*BOOM.*

The gates shook.

"Here they come," Kaelen stood up. "Ready?"

"No," Lyra said. "But let's do it anyway."

They formed a line at the gate. It was pitiful. Fifty soldiers against a horde.

The gates splintered. A wave of Ghouls poured in.

"Hold!" Kaelen shouted.

They fought. It was a meat grinder. Kaelen slashed and hacked, black blood coating his arms. Drakon was a bulwark, smashing ghouls with his shield.

But they were being pushed back. Step by step.

A huge Orc Chieftain (Corrupted) smashed through the line. He raised an axe over Elfiria.

"No!" Kaelen lunged. He wasn't going to make it.

Suddenly, a beam of light fell from the sky.

*CRASH.*

The Orc disintegrated. The shockwave knocked the ghouls back.

In the center of the crater stood a man. He was glowing. Literally glowing.

"Sorry I'm late," Aric said, dusting off his cape. "Traffic was terrible."

## Part 2: The Hero's Aura

The battlefield froze.

"Is that..." a soldier whispered.

"Aric," Kaelen breathed.

Aric drew *Dawnbringer*. The blade shone like the sun at noon. The ghouls hissed and shielded their eyes.

"You boys are ugly," Aric said to the demons. "Let's fix that."

He swung the sword.

*Skill: Solar Arc.*

A wave of golden fire swept out in a hundred-yard cone. It didn't burn like fire; it erased. The ghouls turned to ash instantly. The dark clouds above the fortress parted, letting sunlight stream in.

"For the Alliance!" Aric shouted.

"FOR THE ALLIANCE!" fifty soldiers roared back, their fear replaced instantly by adrenaline and hope.

The tide turned in seconds. With Aric leading, they didn't just hold the gate; they pushed out. They slaughtered the besieging force.

When the last ghoul fell, Aric sheathed his sword. He walked over to Kaelen.

"You held the line," Aric said, placing a hand on Kaelen's shoulder. "Good work."

"We were lucky," Kaelen said.

"Luck is a skill," Aric winked. He looked at Elfiria. "Princess. You look terrible."

"Thank you, Aric," she smiled weakly. "You look... shiny."

"I try."

## Part 3: The Lesson

That evening, the main army arrived. The Fortress was secured.

Aric found Kaelen on the battlements.

"You fight with two swords," Aric noted. "Unusual style."

"It's fast," Kaelen said.

"It's reckless," Aric corrected. "You sacrifice defense for offense. Against fodder, it works. Against a General? It gets you killed."

"I noticed," Kaelen rubbed his bruised ribs.

"Spar with me," Aric said.

"Now? I'm exhausted."

"So is the enemy. Pick up a sword."

They sparred. It was humiliating. Aric didn't use his strength or his magic. He used pure technique. He tapped Kaelen's guard, redirecting his strikes, making him stumble.

"You are reacting," Aric said, tapping Kaelen's forehead with the flat of his blade. "You see my sword move, and you move. Too slow."

"How can I move before you do?"

"Intent," Aric said. "Before I swing, I decide to swing. That decision creates a ripple. A micro-movement in the shoulder. A shift in the eyes. Feel the intent."

Kaelen closed his eyes. He focused. Not on the sword, but on Aric's presence.

*System Focus: Intent Reading.*

He felt a spike of aggression.

Kaelen ducked.

Aric's blade passed where his head had been.

"Good!" Aric laughed. "Again!"

They trained until moonrise.

"You have potential, kid," Aric said, sheathing his sword. "You remind me of myself. Before... well, before."

"Before what?"

"Before I realized that being a Hero means you end up alone," Aric looked at the moon. "People put you on a pedestal. They forget you bleed."

"We don't," Kaelen said. "We're just mercenaries. We know everyone bleeds."

Aric smiled. It was a sad smile. "Maybe that's why I like you. Listen, Kaelen. Tomorrow, we march on the Valley. We face Malakor and the King."

"We'll be ready."

"If... if something happens," Aric hesitated. "If I fall. The Light must continue. You understand?"

"You won't fall," Kaelen said. "You're the Sword Saint."

"Even Saints die," Aric patted his shoulder. "Get some sleep."

## Part 4: The Speech

The next morning, the Grand Army was assembled. Fifty thousand souls.

Aric stood on a podium. He didn't need a magical amplifier. His voice carried.

"Brothers! Sisters!"

Silence fell.

"Today, we walk into the dark! They say the Demon King is a god! They say he cannot be killed! They say we are marching to our graves!"

He drew *Dawnbringer*.

"I say... let them come! Let them see that we do not break! Let them see that the Light shines brightest in the dark! Who is with me?!"

"WE ARE!" The roar was deafening.

"Then charge!"

The army marched. The ground shook.

Kaelen rode beside Lyra.

"He's good," Lyra admitted. "I'd follow him into hell."

"That's exactly where we're going," Kaelen said.

They crossed the ridge and looked down into the Valley of Kings.

It was filled with monsters. A sea of black armor. And in the center, a throne of skulls.

The Demon King was waiting.
