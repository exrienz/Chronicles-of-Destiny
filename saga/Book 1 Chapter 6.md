# Chapter 6: The Alliance Forms

## Prologue: The Spider's Web

*Location: The Shadows of Arcanis*
*Time: Two Days Before the Summit*

The Master of Whispers, Lord Vane (or rather, the thing wearing his skin), sat in the dark. He was reading a report from the Shadow Captain.

"They escaped," he murmured. "The Carrier. The Rogue. The Beast."

He crushed the paper in his hand. The paper hissed and turned to ash, consumed by the necrotic energy seeping from his fingertips.

"And now Elfiria calls a summit. She intends to unite the cattle."

He stood up and walked to a cage in the corner of the room. Inside was a creature—a Doppelganger, formless and shivering. It looked like a puddle of grey mercury, constantly shifting, trying to find a shape that pleased its master.

"You have a new face to wear," Vane whispered to the creature. "Go to the Neutral Spire. Wear the face of a guard. A servant. A friend. It does not matter."

"And the objective?" the creature rasped, forming a mouth for just a second.

"Kill the Princess," Vane smiled. "And if you can... make it look like the Humans did it. Let them tear each other apart before the Demon King even arrives."

## Part 1: The Spire of Unity

*Location: The Neutral Spire*
*Time: The Day of the Summit*

The Neutral Spire was a marvel of ancient architecture. Standing at the intersection of the five borders, it rose five thousand feet into the air—a needle of white marble that pierced the clouds. It was said to have been built by the First King to foster peace.

Today, it was a powder keg.

Kaelen, Lyra, and Drakon arrived at the base. The courtyard was packed with delegations.

"Look at the banners," Lyra pointed. "The Silver Stag of Sylvanaria. The Iron Fist of Kharaz'Mar. The Golden Sun of Aetheria. And... the bloody Lion of Eldoria."

"They are all here," Kaelen noted. "Elfiria has pull."

"Pull, or fear?" Drakon asked, adjusting his new armor—a mismatched set scavenged from the battlefield. It looked ridiculous, but sturdy. He had painted a crude dragon on the chest plate.

They approached the massive gates. Two Stone Golems, twenty feet tall, barred the way. They were carved from living granite, runes glowing blue on their chests.

"Halt," one Golem rumbled. "State your nation."

"We are independent," Kaelen said. "We have information for the High Priestess."

"No independents," the Golem said. "Only delegations. Security Protocol Alpha."

"We are the delegation from the Kingdom of... Not Dying," Lyra tried.

The Golem raised a massive stone fist.

"Wait!" A voice called out.

An elf in silver armor approached. It was Captain Solas, one of Elfiria's guards. He looked tired, dark circles under his eyes.

"I know them," Solas said, eyeing Drakon warily. "They are... expected."

"Access granted," the Golem lowered its fist.

Solas led them inside. The interior was a cavernous hall, echoing with the voices of hundreds of diplomats. The tension was palpable. Hands hovered near sword hilts. Eyes darted suspiciously. The Elves stood on one side, looking down their noses at the Orcs. The Humans glared at everyone.

"The Princess is in the High Chamber," Solas said. "She instructed me to bring you directly to her."

"She knows we're here?" Kaelen asked.

"She said she felt a 'headache' approaching," Solas smirked. "I assumed she meant the Dragon."

"I am not a headache," Drakon grumbled. "I am a migraine. There is a difference."

## Part 2: The High Chamber

They took the magical lift to the top floor. The view was breathtaking—a sea of clouds stretching in all directions.

The High Chamber was a circular room with a round table in the center. Seated there were the most powerful people on the continent.

*   **King Alaric of Eldoria** (represented by General Marcus, as the King was 'indisposed'). Marcus was a burly man with scars and a permanent scowl.
*   **Queen Lyandra of Sylvanaria.** She looked like a statue made of wood and vines, beautiful but alien.
*   **High Chieftain Grok of Kharaz'Mar.** An Orc the size of a bear, picking his teeth with a dagger.
*   **Elder Pyre of Drakoria.** A Dragonborn elder, his scales faded to grey, smoking a pipe that smelled of sulfur.
*   **High Priestess Elfiria of Aetheria.** She sat at the head, radiant in her white robes.

Kaelen walked in. The room went silent.

"Who is this?" General Marcus demanded, standing up. "This is a closed session! I will not have street rats interrupting state business!"

"This is the witness," Elfiria said calmly. She looked tired, but regal. "Speak, Kaelen."

Kaelen stepped forward. He felt out of place in his dirty leather armor amidst the silks and velvets. But he didn't falter.

He threw the Shadow Captain's helmet onto the table. It clattered loudly, spinning before settling in front of Marcus.

"That is an Eldorian helm," Marcus frowned. "Stolen, no doubt."

"Look closer," Kaelen said. "Inside."

Marcus picked it up. He recoiled. The inside of the helmet was coated in black ichor. It smelled of decay.

"What is this filth?"

"Demon blood," Kaelen said. "That man—that *thing*—was leading the attack on Oakhaven. Not Aridia. Not bandits. Demons wearing your armor."

"Lies!" Marcus slammed the helmet down. "This is an Aridian trick! A fabrication to weaken our resolve!"

"I saw it too!" Grok, the Orc Chieftain, slammed his fist on the table. The wood cracked. "My scouts report the same! Black wolves in the desert! Dead men walking! They attacked my caravans!"

"And the forest rots," Queen Lyandra added softly. "My trees scream. The roots drink poison."

"The evidence is clear," Elfiria stood up. "The war is a distraction. While we fight each other, the Demon King prepares his feast."

"So what do you propose?" Elder Pyre asked, smoke curling from his nostrils. "An alliance? We have not fought together since the First Era."

"The Alliance of Light," Elfiria declared. "We combine our armies. We march to the Valley of Kings. We strike the head before the body can move."

"And leave our borders undefended?" Marcus argued. "Impossible. My King would never agree."

"Your King is compromised!" Kaelen shouted. "He's being manipulated by the Shadows!"

"Watch your tongue, boy!" Marcus drew his dagger.

"If we do not do this, there will be no borders left to defend!" Elfiria shouted.

The argument raged. Accusations flew. The fragile peace was cracking.

Kaelen watched. He saw the fear in their eyes. They wanted to believe, but decades of mistrust held them back.

He looked at Drakon. Drakon nodded.

Drakon stepped forward and let out a roar.

*ROAAAAAR!*

It shook the windows. It knocked goblets over. It silenced the room.

"Tiny men!" Drakon bellowed. "And women! You bicker like hatchlings over a worm! Do you not see? The worm is poisoned! The enemy does not care about your flags! He eats flags! He eats kings! He eats dragons!"

He pointed a claw at Grok. "You! Orc! You say you are strong? Prove it! Fight the real enemy!"

He pointed at Marcus. "You! Soldier! You claim honor? There is no honor in fighting a puppet war!"

"The beast speaks truth," Grok grunted, impressed. "I like him. He is loud."

"We will join," Queen Lyandra said. "For the trees."

"Drakoria stands with the light," Elder Pyre nodded.

All eyes turned to Marcus. Eldoria was the largest military power. Without them, the Alliance was weak.

Marcus looked at the helmet. He looked at Kaelen.

"If this is true," Marcus said slowly. "Then my King has been betrayed. Eldoria... will march."

A sigh of relief swept the room.

"It is done," Elfiria said. "The Alliance is formed."

## Part 3: The Shadow in the Room

The Summit concluded with a signing ceremony. Servants brought in wine to toast the new Alliance.

Kaelen stood by the window, watching the sun set.

"You did good," Lyra said, appearing beside him. She snagged a tart from a passing tray. "For a brooding mercenary."

"Drakon did the heavy lifting," Kaelen smiled.

"He does have a way with words. Mostly loud ones."

Elfiria approached them. She held a goblet of wine.

"Kaelen," she said. "Thank you."

"Just doing my job, Princess."

"No," she shook her head. "You gave me hope. I was... ready to give up."

She raised the goblet to her lips.

*System Passive Scan: Active.*
*Target: Wine Goblet.*
*Analysis: Trace elements of Nightshade. Arsenic.*
*Conclusion: POISON.*

"Don't drink!" Kaelen slapped the goblet from her hand.

It shattered on the floor. The wine sizzled as it hit the rug, burning a hole through the fabric.

"Poison!" Kaelen shouted.

The room erupted. Guards drew swords.

"The servant!" Lyra pointed.

The servant who had brought the wine was backing away. His face... rippled. It shifted, melting like wax, revealing a grey, featureless visage.

*System Alert: Doppelganger Assassin.*

"For the Master!" the assassin shrieked. It drew a dagger and lunged—not at Elfiria, but at General Marcus.

If Marcus died here, Eldoria would blame the others. The Alliance would shatter instantly.

"Drakon! Block him!"

Drakon was too far away.

Kaelen activated *Flash Step*. He moved faster than thought. He intercepted the assassin mid-air.

*Shing.*

Kaelen's blade met the assassin's dagger. Sparks flew.

"Die, human!" the assassin hissed.

"Not today!" Kaelen twisted his blade, disarming the creature. He spun and delivered a roundhouse kick, sending the assassin crashing into the wall.

"Hold him!" Grok yelled. Orc guards piled onto the assassin.

The creature laughed. A high, gurgling sound.

"It... has... begun..."

It bit down on something in its mouth. Foam bubbled from its lips, and it went limp. Suicide pill.

Silence returned.

General Marcus stared at the dead assassin, then at Kaelen.

"He saved your life, General," Elfiria said, her voice shaking with rage. "Are you still unsure about the enemy?"

Marcus drew his sword. He walked over to Kaelen.

Kaelen tensed.

Marcus reversed the sword, offering the hilt. "Eldoria is in your debt, Master Kaelen. We march at dawn."

***

## Part 4: The Decree

That evening, the orders were written. The Grand Army of the Alliance would assemble in the Valley of Kings.

Kaelen found himself on the balcony again, looking at the stars.

"You have a habit of saving royalty," Elfiria said, joining him.

"Bad habit," Kaelen said. "Doesn't pay well."

"I can pay you," she said. "Name your price."

"I don't want gold," Kaelen said. "I want... to win. I want to stop looking over my shoulder."

"Then we have the same goal," she stood next to him. "Kaelen... I need a Commander for my personal guard. The 'Dawn's Light'. Will you take the post?"

"I'm a mercenary, Elfiria. I don't follow orders well."

"I don't need a follower," she turned to him, her eyes searching his. "I need a partner. Someone who sees the truth."

Kaelen looked at her. Really looked at her. Beneath the crown and the magic, she was just a girl scared of the dark.

"I'll do it," Kaelen said. "On one condition."

"Which is?"

"Drakon gets unlimited food. And Lyra gets... well, whatever Lyra wants. Probably immunity from prosecution."

Elfiria laughed. A real, genuine laugh. "Done."

She reached out and took his hand.

*System Alert: Bond Formed.*
*Target: Elfiria.*
*Relationship Level: Ally -> Trusted.*

"To the Alliance," she whispered.

"To the Alliance," Kaelen agreed.

But as he looked at the horizon, he couldn't shake the feeling that the Shadow Master was watching. And smiling.

*System Alert: Chapter Completed.*
*World State Update: Alliance Formed. War Mobilization.*
*Party Status: Promoted.*
