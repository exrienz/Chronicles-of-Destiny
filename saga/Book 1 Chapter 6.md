# Chapter 6: The Alliance Forms

## Prologue: The Spider's Web

*Location: The Shadows of Arcanis, Capital of Eldoria*
*Time: Two Days Before the Summit*

The Master of Whispers, Lord Vane—or rather, the entity currently wearing his skin like a tailored suit—sat in the dark. The room was cold, the fire in the hearth burning with a sickly green hue that offered no warmth, only illumination for the documents scattered across the mahogany desk.

He was reading a report from the Shadow Captain, written in blood on human skin parchment.

"They escaped," he murmured, his voice a sound like dry leaves skittering on stone. "The Carrier. The Rogue. The Beast."

He crushed the parchment in his hand. It didn't just crumble; it hissed and turned to ash, consumed by the necrotic energy seeping from his fingertips.

"And now Elfiria calls a summit. She intends to unite the cattle."

He stood up, his movements fluid and unnatural, joints bending at slightly wrong angles. He walked to a cage in the corner of the room. Inside was a creature—a Doppelganger, formless and shivering. It looked like a puddle of grey mercury, constantly shifting, trying to find a shape that pleased its master. It formed a hand, then a face, then a claw, in a desperate cycle of mimicry.

"You have a new face to wear," Vane whispered to the creature, unlocking the cage with a wave of his hand. "Go to the Neutral Spire. Wear the face of a guard. A servant. A friend. It does not matter."

The creature oozed out of the cage, pooling at his feet. "And the objective?" it rasped, forming a mouth for just a second.

"Kill the Princess," Vane smiled, exposing teeth that were too sharp, too many. "But do not be simple about it. If you kill her outright, she becomes a martyr. No... make it look like the Humans did it. Plant the dagger of an Eldorian assassin. Let them tear each other apart before the Demon King even arrives."

"I obey," the puddle hissed, sinking into the floorboards.

Vane turned back to the window, looking out over the city he was slowly poisoning from the inside.

"Dance, puppets," he whispered. "Dance until your strings snap."

## Part 1: The Spire of Unity

*Location: The Neutral Spire*
*Time: The Day of the Summit*

The Neutral Spire was a marvel of ancient architecture, a relic of the Age of Wonder. Standing at the precise intersection of the five borders, it rose five thousand feet into the air—a needle of white marble that pierced the clouds. It was said to have been built by the First King, utilizing the combined magic of Elves, Dwarves, and Humans to foster peace. Gravity seemed to have no hold on the upper levels, which floated detached from the base, held in place by massive chains of light.

Today, it was a powder keg waiting for a spark.

Kaelen, Lyra, and Drakon stood at the base of the Spire. The courtyard was a chaotic sea of banners, armor, and racial tension.

"Look at them," Lyra pointed, her voice low. "The Silver Stag of Sylvanaria. The Iron Fist of Kharaz'Mar. The Golden Sun of Aetheria. And... the bloody Lion of Eldoria."

"They are all here," Kaelen noted. "Elfiria has pull."

"Pull, or fear?" Drakon asked, adjusting his new armor. It was a mismatched set scavenged from the battlefield and resized by a terrified blacksmith in the lower city. It looked ridiculous—an Orcish pauldron, a Human breastplate, and Dwarven greaves—but it was sturdy. He had painted a crude red dragon on the chest plate with berry juice. "They smell of fear. It smells like... wet dog and vinegar."

They approached the massive gates. Two Stone Golems, twenty feet tall, barred the way. They were carved from living granite, runes glowing pulsating blue on their chests. They held halberds the size of tree trunks.

"Halt," one Golem rumbled. The sound vibrated in Kaelen's teeth. "State your nation."

"We are independent," Kaelen said, stepping forward. "We have information for the High Priestess."

"No independents," the Golem said, its voice devoid of emotion. "Only delegations. Security Protocol Alpha in effect. Return to your point of origin or be neutralized."

The Golem raised a massive stone foot.

"We are the delegation from the Kingdom of... Not Dying," Lyra tried, putting on her most charming smile. "Our export is 'not being eaten by demons'. Interested?"

The Golem paused, processing. "Kingdom not recognized. Threat detected. Preparing neutralization."

"Wait!" A voice called out.

An elf in silver armor approached from the side gate. It was Captain Solas, one of Elfiria's personal guards. He looked tired, dark circles under his eyes, his armor scuffed.

"I know them," Solas said, eyeing Drakon warily. "They are... expected. By the High Priestess herself."

The Golem lowered its foot. "Override accepted. Welcome, guests."

Solas led them inside. The interior was a cavernous hall, echoing with the voices of hundreds of diplomats, soldiers, and spies. The tension was palpable. Hands hovered near sword hilts. Eyes darted suspiciously. The Elves stood on one side, looking down their noses at the Orcs, who were growling at the Dwarves, who were arguing about stone quality with the Humans.

"The Princess is in the High Chamber," Solas said, guiding them through the crowd. "She instructed me to bring you directly to her. Do not speak to anyone. Do not look at anyone. And for the love of the Light, keep the lizard quiet."

"I am not a lizard," Drakon grumbled. "I am a Draconian. We are noble descendants of the Sky Kings."

"You're eating a turkey leg you pulled out of your pocket," Lyra pointed out.

"I am a hungry noble descendant," Drakon corrected, taking a massive bite.

"She knows we're here?" Kaelen asked.

"She said she felt a 'headache' approaching," Solas smirked. "I assumed she meant the political situation. Now I see she meant you three."

"Before we go up," Solas said, "We must pass through the camps. The High Priestess wants you to see the... state of things. And you should see the Spire itself. It is... humbling."

They walked through the massive courtyard that surrounded the Spire. The structure was even more impressive up close. It was not built of bricks, but seemed to have been sung into existence from the bedrock itself. Intricate carvings depicted the history of the world: the First Era of Gods, the Second Era of Dragons, and the current Third Era of Men and Elves.

"It vibrates," Drakon noted, placing a hand on the white stone. "Like a sleeping cat."

"It's the mana conduits," Solas explained. "The Spire acts as a lightning rod for the world's magic. It stabilizes the leylines. If it falls, the continent would likely crack in half."

"No pressure then," Lyra muttered.

They continued into the tent city. It was less a courtyard and more a sprawling metropolis of canvas and tension, segregated by nation.

To the west were the Sylvanarians. Their tents were grown from living wood, humming with nature magic. Vines wove themselves into walls and roofs in seconds. Elven archers sharpened arrows made of ironwood, eyeing the humans with distrust. They sang soft, mournful songs that made the air feel heavy with nostalgia.

To the east were the Eldorians. Rows of rigid, military tents, perfectly aligned. Soldiers drilled in formation, shouting in unison. The smell of oil, steel, and unwashed bodies hung heavy in the air. Smiths hammered away at portable forges, repairing armor dented in border skirmishes.

To the north, the Orcs of Kharaz'Mar. Their camp was a chaotic sprawl of bonfires and sparring pits. Orcs wrestled in the mud, roaring with laughter and rage. The air smelled of roasting meat and potent spices. Totems made of bone and feathers marked the boundaries of their territory.

And to the south, the Dragonborn of Drakoria. They didn't use tents; they slept on heated stones, surrounded by steam vents they had magically summoned from the earth. They sat in meditation, their scales shimmering in the steam, looking like statues of living gem.

"It is a powder keg," Kaelen observed. "One spark, and they kill each other."

"Exactly," Solas said. "Just this morning, an Orc broke an Elf's nose because he 'looked at him funny'. And an Eldorian knight challenged a Dragonborn to a duel over a spilled drink."

"Discipline is lacking," Drakon critiqued. "They have energy, but no focus."

They passed a group of Eldorian soldiers. One of them, a young sergeant, spat on the ground as Solas passed.

"Pointy-eared lovers," the sergeant muttered.

Solas didn't react, but his knuckles whitened on his sword hilt.

"Hey!" Lyra stopped. She walked up to the sergeant. "You dropped something."

"What?" The sergeant looked down.

Lyra kicked him in the shin. Hard.

"Argh!" He hopped on one foot. "You little rat!"

"Respect the uniform," Lyra said sweetly. "Or I'll aim higher next time."

The sergeant's friends laughed. The tension broke, replaced by amusement at their comrade's misfortune.

"You have a unique diplomatic style," Solas noted, a faint smile on his lips.

"I call it 'aggressive negotiation'," Lyra winked.

***

## Part 2: The High Chamber

They took the magical lift to the top floor. The sensation was disorienting, a sudden lurch of the stomach as gravity reversed. The view from the glass walls was breathtaking—a sea of clouds stretching in all directions, with the peaks of the Dragon's Spine mountains poking through like islands in a white ocean.

The High Chamber was a circular room with a round table in the center, made of a single slab of weirwood. Seated there were the most powerful people on the continent.

*   **King Alaric of Eldoria** was absent. His seat was taken by **General Marcus**, the Iron Wall. Marcus was a burly man with scars that mapped a history of violence on his face. He wore plate armor even to a peace summit.
*   **Queen Lyandra of Sylvanaria.** She looked like a statue made of wood and vines, beautiful but alien. Her hair was moss, her eyes were pools of sap. She sat perfectly still.
*   **High Chieftain Grok of Kharaz'Mar.** An Orc the size of a bear, picking his teeth with a dagger. He wore the skulls of his enemies as pauldrons. He looked bored.
*   **Elder Pyre of Drakoria.** A Dragonborn elder, his scales faded to grey, smoking a pipe that smelled of sulfur and brimstone. He was one of the few who looked calm.
*   **High Priestess Elfiria of Aetheria.** She sat at the head, radiant in her white robes. She looked exhausted, her light dimmed by the weight of the room.

Kaelen walked in. The room went silent.

"Who is this?" General Marcus demanded, standing up. His chair scraped loudly against the floor. "This is a closed session! I will not have street rats interrupting state business! Guards!"

"This is the witness," Elfiria said calmly. Her voice was soft, but it carried authority. "Sit down, Marcus."

"I take orders from my King, not an Elf witch," Marcus spat.

"Your King is not here," Elfiria countered. "Speak, Kaelen."

Kaelen stepped forward. He felt out of place in his dirty leather armor amidst the silks and velvets. He felt the weight of their gazes—scorn, curiosity, hostility.

He threw the Shadow Captain's helmet onto the table. It clattered loudly, spinning before settling in front of Marcus.

"That is an Eldorian helm," Marcus frowned. "Stolen, no doubt. Typical mercenary trash."

"Look closer," Kaelen said. "Inside."

Marcus picked it up with disdain. He recoiled. The inside of the helmet was coated in black ichor. It smelled of decay and old blood.

"What is this filth?"

"Demon blood," Kaelen said. "That man—that *thing*—was leading the attack on Oakhaven. Not Aridia. Not bandits. Demons wearing your armor."

"Lies!" Marcus slammed the helmet down. "This is an Aridian trick! A fabrication to weaken our resolve! You hired this... actor to sow discord!"

"I saw it too!" Grok, the Orc Chieftain, slammed his fist on the table. The wood cracked. "My scouts report the same! Black wolves in the desert! Dead men walking! They attacked my caravans! My warriors bleed red. These things bleed black!"

"And the forest rots," Queen Lyandra added softly. Her voice sounded like wind in the leaves. "My trees scream. The roots drink poison. The animals are going mad."

"The evidence is clear," Elfiria stood up. "The war is a distraction. While we fight each other, the Demon King prepares his feast."

"So what do you propose?" Elder Pyre asked, smoke curling from his nostrils. "An alliance? We have not fought together since the First Era. The blood feuds run deep."

"The Alliance of Light," Elfiria declared. "We combine our armies. We march to the Valley of Kings. We strike the head before the body can move."

"And leave our borders undefended?" Marcus argued. "Impossible. My King would never agree. Aridia is massing on our southern border!"

"Your King is compromised!" Kaelen shouted. "He's being manipulated by the Shadows! Can't you see? The orders to attack Oakhaven didn't make sense. It was a strategic suicide. It was a sacrifice!"

"Watch your tongue, boy!" Marcus drew his dagger. "Or I will cut it out!"

"If we do not do this, there will be no borders left to defend!" Elfiria shouted, her aura flaring. The room bathed in blinding light.

The argument raged. Accusations flew. The fragile peace was cracking. The Orcs shouted at the Elves. The Humans shouted at the Orcs.

Kaelen watched. He saw the fear in their eyes. They wanted to believe, but decades of mistrust held them back. They were paralyzed by history.

He looked at Drakon. Drakon nodded.

Drakon stepped forward and let out a roar.

*ROAAAAAR!*

It wasn't just a shout. It was a dragon's roar. It shook the windows. It knocked goblets over. It vibrated in the marrow of their bones. It silenced the room instantly.

"Tiny men!" Drakon bellowed. "And women! You bicker like hatchlings over a worm! Do you not see? The worm is poisoned! The enemy does not care about your flags! He eats flags! He eats kings! He eats dragons!"

He pointed a claw at Grok. "You! Orc! You say you are strong? Prove it! Fight the real enemy! Or are you afraid of the dark?"

Grok growled, a low rumble that started in his chest. "You question my courage, lizard? I have killed Hill Giants with my bare hands. I have wrestled Cave Bears for sport."

"Hill Giants are slow," Drakon scoffed. "And bears are just big dogs. The Demons are faster. Stronger. They do not wrestle. They tear."

Grok slammed his hand on the table again. "You talk big. Do you fight big?"

"I fight efficiently," Drakon said.

"A duel!" Grok shouted. "To first blood! If the lizard wins, I listen. If I win, I make him into a belt."

"This is a peace summit!" Elfiria protested.

"Peace is forged in iron," Grok retorted. "I do not trust words. I trust strength. Let us see if the Alliance has strength."

General Marcus leaned forward, interested. "I agree. Let us see if this 'hero's' companion is more than just hot air."

Elfiria looked at Kaelen. Kaelen nodded. "Drakon won't kill him."

"I might maim him a little," Drakon whispered. "Just a toe. Orc toes are delicacies in some cultures."

"No eating the delegates," Kaelen ordered.

"Fine. Spoilsport."

The circle cleared. The diplomats pushed back their chairs. The tension was electric. This was more than a fight; it was a clash of ideologies. Primal strength versus... whatever Drakon was.

Grok drew a massive axe, the blade chipped and stained with what Kaelen hoped was rust but suspected was dried blood. Drakon cracked his knuckles and picked up a heavy iron chair.

"A chair?" Grok laughed. "You fight with furniture?"

"It is ergonomic," Drakon said.

"Begin!" Marcus shouted.

Grok charged. He was fast for his size, a blur of muscle and fury. He swung the axe in a horizontal arc that would have decapitated a horse.

Drakon didn't dodge. He caught the axe handle with the chair legs.

*CRUNCH.*

The wood splintered, but it held the blade. Drakon twisted the chair, wrenching the axe from Grok's grip.

"Disarmed," Drakon stated.

Grok didn't pause. He roared and tackled Drakon. They crashed into the table, sending maps and quills flying.

It was a brawl of titans. Grok punched Drakon in the jaw. Drakon headbutted Grok.

*System Alert: Combat Analysis.*
*Drakon HP: 95%.*
*Grok HP: 90%.*

"You hit like a goblin!" Drakon taunted, grabbing Grok by the tusks.

"You smell like a swamp!" Grok retorted, trying to gouge Drakon's eyes.

Drakon roared and breathed a small gout of flame—not enough to burn, but enough to startle. Grok flinched. Drakon used the opening to sweep Grok's legs and pin him to the ground.

"Yield!" Drakon shouted, his fist raised.

Grok looked up at the dragon-kin. He started to laugh.

"Good!" Grok roared. "Good fight!"

Drakon blinked. "You... are happy?"

"You are strong!" Grok patted Drakon's arm. "You are not a lizard. You are a warrior. I yield."

Drakon helped him up. "You are not bad, for a squishy thing."

"The beast speaks truth," Grok grunted, dusting himself off. "I like him. He is loud. And he smells of blood."

"We will join," Queen Lyandra said. "For the trees. If the forest dies, we die."

"Drakoria stands with the light," Elder Pyre nodded. "My bones ache with the coming storm. It is time to fly again."

All eyes turned to Marcus. Eldoria was the largest military power. Without them, the Alliance was weak.

Marcus looked at the helmet. He looked at Kaelen. He looked at the map on the table.

"If this is true," Marcus said slowly. "Then my King has been betrayed. If demons walk in Eldoria... then I have a duty to purge them."

He sheathed his dagger. "Eldoria... will march."

A sigh of relief swept the room.

"It is done," Elfiria said. "The Alliance is formed."

## Part 3: The Shadow in the Room

The Summit concluded with a signing ceremony. Servants brought in wine to toast the new Alliance. The mood shifted from hostile to cautious optimism.

Kaelen stood by the window, watching the sun set over the clouds. The light turned the sky into a canvas of orange and purple.

"You did good," Lyra said, appearing beside him. She snagged a tart from a passing tray. "For a brooding mercenary."

"Drakon did the heavy lifting," Kaelen smiled.

"He does have a way with words. Mostly loud ones. But effective."

Elfiria approached them. She held a goblet of wine. She looked less like a High Priestess and more like a young woman who had just run a marathon.

"Kaelen," she said. "Thank you."

"Just doing my job, Princess."

"No," she shook her head. "You gave me hope. I was... ready to give up. The Council... they drain me."

She raised the goblet to her lips.

*System Passive Scan: Active.*
*Target: Wine Goblet.*
*Analysis: Trace elements of Nightshade. Arsenic. Necrotic Residue.*
*Conclusion: POISON (Lethal).*

"Don't drink!" Kaelen slapped the goblet from her hand.

It shattered on the floor. The wine sizzled as it hit the rug, burning a hole through the fabric and eating into the stone beneath.

"Poison!" Kaelen shouted.

The room erupted. Guards drew swords.

"The servant!" Lyra pointed.

The servant who had brought the wine was backing away. His face... rippled. It shifted, melting like wax, revealing a grey, featureless visage.

*System Alert: Doppelganger Assassin.*
*Level: 20.*

"For the Master!" the assassin shrieked. It drew a dagger and lunged—not at Elfiria, but at General Marcus.

If Marcus died here, Eldoria would blame the others. The Alliance would shatter instantly.

"Drakon! Block him!"

Drakon was too far away, arguing with a waiter about portion sizes.

Kaelen activated *Flash Step*. He moved faster than thought. He intercepted the assassin mid-air.

*Shing.*

Kaelen's blade met the assassin's dagger. Sparks flew.

"Die, human!" the assassin hissed.

"Not today!" Kaelen twisted his blade, disarming the creature. He spun and delivered a roundhouse kick, sending the assassin crashing into the wall.

But it wasn't over.

"There's more!" Lyra shouted.

From the shadows of the ceiling, three more shapes dropped. Doppelgangers. They wore the uniforms of Sylvanarian Archers.

*System Alert: Ambush Detected.*
*Hostiles: 4.*

One assassin aimed a crossbow at Queen Lyandra.

"Protect the Queen!" Solas shouted, diving in front of her. The bolt took him in the shoulder.

Another assassin charged Elder Pyre. The old dragonborn didn't even move. He simply opened his mouth and exhaled a cloud of ash. The assassin choked, blinded.

"Messy," Pyre grumbled, whacking the assassin with his cane.

The third assassin went for Kaelen, trying to flank him while he dealt with the first one.

"Two on one?" Kaelen grinned, his adrenaline spiking. "I like those odds."

*Skill: Blade Dance.*

Kaelen became a whirlwind. He ducked under a dagger slash, parried a sword thrust, and riposted with a dual strike.

*Hit. Hit. Hit.*

The first assassin fell, bleeding silver fluid.

The flanking assassin hesitated. That was his mistake.

Lyra was there. She didn't fight fair. She jumped onto his back, wrapped her legs around his neck, and drove her daggers into his shoulders.

"Nighty night!" she chirped.

The assassin crumbled.

"Hold him!" Grok yelled as his guards piled onto the last standing assassin.

The creature laughed. A high, gurgling sound.

"It... has... begun..."

It bit down on something in its mouth. Foam bubbled from its lips, and it went limp. Suicide pill.

Silence returned.

General Marcus stared at the dead assassin, then at Kaelen.

"He saved your life, General," Elfiria said, her voice shaking with rage. "Are you still unsure about the enemy?"

Marcus drew his sword. He walked over to Kaelen.

Kaelen tensed, hand on his hilt.

Marcus reversed the sword, offering the hilt. "Eldoria is in your debt, Master Kaelen. We march at dawn."

***

## Interlude: The General's Doubt

*Location: The Eldorian Camp*
*Time: One Hour Later*

General Marcus sat in his command tent, staring at the map of the continent. He poured himself a glass of water, his hands shaking slightly.

He was a man of logic. Of tactics. He understood supply lines, flanking maneuvers, and siege engines. He did not understand demons.

"Sir?" His lieutenant, a young man named Thorne, entered. "The men are restless. They say... they say we are marching north? To join the Elves?"

"We are," Marcus said, his voice gravel.

"But... the King's orders were to hold the southern border against Aridia," Thorne stammered. "If we leave, we defy the Crown. That is treason."

Marcus looked at the helmet sitting on his desk. The black ichor had dried, but the smell remained.

"The King is not himself, Thorne," Marcus said quietly. "I have received letters. Strange orders. Burn villages. Slaughter civilians. 'Cleanse the weak'. I told myself it was for the greater good. That the King knew something I didn't."

He stood up and walked to the tent flap, looking out at his army. Ten thousand men. Good men. Fathers. Sons.

"I was wrong," Marcus whispered. "I was following the orders of a monster."

"Sir?"

"Prepare the legion, Thorne," Marcus commanded, his voice hardening into the steel that had earned him the name 'Iron Wall'. "We are not fighting for the King anymore. We are fighting for the Kingdom. And if that is treason... then let history judge us."

Thorne saluted, a spark of relief in his eyes. "Yes, General!"

***

## Part 4: The Decree

That evening, the orders were written. The Grand Army of the Alliance would assemble in the Valley of Kings.

Kaelen found himself on the balcony again, looking at the stars.

"You have a habit of saving royalty," Elfiria said, joining him. She had changed into simpler robes, moonlight silver.

"Bad habit," Kaelen said. "Doesn't pay well."

"I can pay you," she said. "Name your price."

"I don't want gold," Kaelen said. "I want... to win. I want to stop looking over my shoulder. I want to know that when I sleep, I won't wake up to smoke."

"Then we have the same goal," she stood next to him. The distance between them felt charged. "Kaelen... I need a Commander for my personal guard. The 'Dawn's Light'. Will you take the post?"

"I'm a mercenary, Elfiria. I don't follow orders well."

"I don't need a follower," she turned to him, her eyes searching his. "I need a partner. Someone who sees the truth. Someone who isn't afraid to slap a goblet out of my hand."

Kaelen looked at her. Really looked at her. Beneath the crown and the magic, she was just a girl scared of the dark, carrying the weight of the world.

"I'll do it," Kaelen said. "On one condition."

"Which is?"

"Drakon gets unlimited food. And Lyra gets... well, whatever Lyra wants. Probably immunity from prosecution."

Elfiria laughed. A real, genuine laugh. "Done."

She reached out and took his hand. Her skin was warm, tingling with magic.

*System Alert: Bond Formed.*
*Target: Elfiria.*
*Relationship Level: Ally -> Trusted.*
*New Title: Commander of the Dawn.*

"To the Alliance," she whispered.

"To the Alliance," Kaelen agreed.

But as he looked at the horizon, he couldn't shake the feeling that the Shadow Master was watching. And smiling.

***

## Interlude: The Dragon's Feast

*Location: The Royal Kitchens*
*Time: Midnight*

The Head Chef of the Spire, a stout Dwarf named Brombli, was having a panic attack.

"He's still eating!" a sous-chef screamed, running out of the pantry. "He ate the cheese wheel! The *big* cheese wheel!"

Brombli peered around the corner. Sitting on the floor, surrounded by empty barrels and picked-clean bones, was Drakon.

The dragon-kin held a leg of ham in one hand and a jug of mead in the other. He looked like a king in his own right.

"More!" Drakon bellowed happily. "This pig was delicious! Bring me its brother!"

"We... we are out of pig, my lord!" Brombli squeaked.

Drakon frowned. "Out of pig? How can a castle be out of pig? What kind of kingdom is this?"

"We have... salad?" the sous-chef offered trembling.

Drakon stared at the bowl of leafy greens. He sniffed it.

"That is food for my food," Drakon said dismissively. "Bring me... the cow."

"Which cow?"

"All of them."

Brombli fainted.

***

## Epilogue: The First Night

The Spire did not sleep. Even late at night, the halls buzzed with activity as the Alliance mobilized.

Kaelen walked the corridors, unable to rest. His new quarters were lavish—silk sheets, a hot bath, a view of the stars—but he felt trapped. He missed the campfire. He missed the simplicity of the road.

He found himself in the training grounds on the lower levels. It was empty, save for one figure.

A tall, green-skinned woman was practicing with a spear. It was Captain Zara, Grok's second-in-command. She moved with a fluid, deadly grace, striking training dummies with precision.

*Thwack. Thwack. Thwack.*

She sensed him. She spun, the spear tip stopping an inch from his throat.

"You walk softly for a human," she grunted.

"Mercenary habit," Kaelen said, raising his hands. "Just watching."

"Watch elsewhere," she lowered the spear. "I do not like audiences."

"You're fast," Kaelen noted. "But you're overextending on the thrust. Leaves your left side open."

Zara narrowed her eyes. "You criticize my form? I have killed fifty men with this spear."

"And the fifty-first would have stabbed you in the ribs," Kaelen stepped forward, drawing a training sword from the rack. "Show me."

Zara grinned, revealing tusks. "You will regret this, little man."

They sparred. It wasn't a duel to the death, but a conversation in steel and wood. Zara was strong, overpowering, but Kaelen was technical. He dodged, parried, and tapped her ribs with the flat of his blade.

"Dead," Kaelen said.

"Again!" Zara roared.

They fought for an hour, sweating, bruising, and learning. By the end, they were both sitting on the floor, exhausted.

"You fight well," Zara admitted, wiping sweat from her brow. "For a human."

"You're not bad," Kaelen smiled. "For an Orc."

"This Alliance," Zara said, looking at the ceiling. "Do you think it will work?"

"I don't know," Kaelen admitted. "But it's better than the alternative."

"The alternative is death," Zara said. "I choose life. And I choose to kill demons."

She stood up and offered him a hand. Her grip was like a vice.

"If we fight side by side, Kaelen," she said. "Watch my left."

"And you watch my back," Kaelen replied.

"Done."

He watched her leave. He felt a little less alone. The Alliance was fragile, made of paper and promises, but maybe... just maybe... it would hold.

*System Alert: Chapter Completed.*
*World State Update: Alliance Formed. War Mobilization.*
*Party Status: Promoted. New Ally: Captain Zara.*

**[End of Chapter 6]**
