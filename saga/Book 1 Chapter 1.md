# Chapter 1: The Shadow of War

## Prologue

In the deepest recesses of the Void, where light was not just absent but actively hunted, something stirred. It was an ancient consciousness, fragmented and formless, yet bound by a singular purpose: *Return*.

Across the material plane of Mythosia, the signs were subtle at first. A farmer in Eldoria finding his crops blighted by a strange, oily rot. A fisherman in Aquilonia hauling up nets filled with dead, glassy-eyed sea serpents. In the high courts of the kingdoms, whispers of betrayal were sown like poisonous seeds, taking root in the fertile soil of paranoia.

General Malakor stood atop the Spire of Anguish, a jagged peak in the Unexplored Lands that pierced the cloud layer. The wind here screamed, carrying the souls of the damned, but to Malakor, it was a sweet lullaby. He was a Demon General, a being of pure malice clad in armor forged from the void itself. His eyes, burning like dying stars, looked south towards the lights of civilization.

"The seals are crumbling," a voice rasped behind him. It was Xylos, the Shadow Weaver, another of the Seven. Xylos was less a physical being and more a collection of tattered robes and darkness.

"Not fast enough," Malakor grumbled, his voice deep enough to vibrate the stone beneath their feet. "The humans and their allies... they are complacent, but they are numerous. If they unite, they could still pose a threat."

Xylos chuckled, a sound like dry leaves skittering on pavement. "Unity? You overestimate them, Malakor. I have already begun the work. In Eldoria, they see enemies in the shadows. In Drakoria, they hoard their gold and suspect thieves in every corner. We have turned their caution into fear, and their fear into hate."

Malakor clenched his gauntleted fist. "Fear is good. But blood is better. The Master needs sustenance. He needs the Great Sorrow."

"He shall have it," Xylos promised. "I have dispatched the Silent Ones. They are moving into position. A small spark here, a false flag there... and the world will burn itself down for us. We won't even have to unsheathe our blades until the pyre is already high."

Malakor smiled, revealing rows of shark-like teeth. "See that it is done. The Dance of Life and Death begins now. And this time, the music stops only when everything is silence."

## Part 1: The Rusty Blade

The ale in the mug was warm, flat, and tasted like it had been filtered through a goblin’s loincloth. Kaelen stared at it with a kind of grim fascination, swirling the murky liquid. The 'Rusty Blade' tavern lived up to its name—everything in it was old, dull, or on the verge of breaking. Much like the border town of Oakhaven itself.

Kaelen leaned back in the rickety wooden chair, the wood groaning in protest under his lean frame. He didn't fit in with the local farmers and weary travelers huddled near the hearth. His gear, though worn, was well-maintained. The leather armor hugging his chest was oiled to a matte finish, designed for silence and mobility rather than brute deflection. Two swords rested at his hip—one a standard steel longsword, the other a slightly shorter blade with a hilt wrapped in faded blue cloth. They were the tools of his trade, and currently, his trade was slow.

The tavern was a sensory assault. The air was thick with the smell of roasting meats, unwashed bodies, and cheap tobacco. A bard in the corner, clearly past his prime, was butchering a classic ballad about a knight and a dragon, getting most of the chords wrong. But the patrons didn't care; they were too busy drowning their sorrows or shouting over dice games.

"You gonna drink that, stranger, or just romance it?"

The serving girl, a buxom woman with a smear of soot on her cheek and an apron that had seen better decades, loomed over his table. She had a tired smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. Her name was Mara, and she was the closest thing to a friend Kaelen had in this dust-trap of a town.

Kaelen looked up, a dry smirk touching his lips. "I'm debating if drinking it counts as a constitution test. What do you think, Mara? If I survive this pint, do I level up?"

Mara snorted, a laugh escaping her. She leaned a hip against the table, the action bringing her ample chest closer to his eye level—a deliberate move. "It'll put hair on your chest, mercenary. Or strip the lining of your stomach. Either way, you pay for the privilege. And leveling up? Honey, around here, the only thing that goes up is the price of grain and the crime rate."

"Fair enough." Kaelen tossed a silver coin onto the scarred table. It spun and settled with a ring that cut through the low murmur of the room. "Keep the change. I might need you to drag my corpse out later."

Mara scooped up the coin, her fingers brushing his hand—a lingering touch that was professional yet suggestive. Her skin was rough, calloused from work, but warm. "If you drop dead, I'm taking the swords. They look worth more than the rest of you combined." She winked, her voice dropping an octave. "Though, it would be a shame to waste such a pretty face on the grave. Maybe later, if you're still breathing, you can come by the back room? I have a bottle of wine that actually came from a grape, not a potato."

Kaelen watched her go, his smile fading slightly. It was a tempting offer. Mara was warm, willing, and uncomplicated. Exactly what a man in his profession usually craved. But tonight, the itch in his gut wasn't for companionship. It was for danger.

He could feel it in the air—a tension that was tighter than a bowstring. Rumors were bleeding in from the capital, Arcanis. Whispers of troop movements, of diplomats vanishing, of shadows stretching longer than they should. The local garrison had been doubling patrols, but they looked jumpy, eyeing the shadows like they expected monsters to leap out.

Eldoria was a kingdom built on magic and history, but lately, it felt like a house of cards waiting for a stiff breeze. And Kaelen, for all his cynicism, hated the feeling of helplessness that came with it. He was a swordsman, a problem solver. But you couldn't stab a rumor.

He took a sip of the ale. It was awful. He grimaced and set it down.

The tavern door creaked open, admitting a gust of cold night air and a figure that looked desperately out of place. The man was draped in a cloak of fine velvet, though it was mud-spattered and torn at the hem. Underneath, glints of gold embroidery and polished boots betrayed his status immediately. A noble. And a nervous one at that.

The room went quiet. Eyes shifted. In a border town, wealth was like blood in the water. The farmers stopped talking. The dice players froze mid-throw. Even the bad bard faltered.

The noble scanned the room, his gaze frantic, practically vibrating with anxiety. He looked like a rabbit that had wandered into a den of wolves. His eyes darted from face to face, dismissing the farmers, the drunks, the whores. Until they landed on Kaelen. Or rather, on the swords at Kaelen’s hip.

He practically scrambled over, ignoring the stares, his boots clicking loudly on the uneven floorboards.

"You," the man breathed, his voice trembling. "You are a sellsword? A mercenary?"

Kaelen took another sip of the terrible ale, grimacing. He didn't look up immediately. "Depends on who's asking, and how heavy their purse is. And usually, I prefer to be asked with a bit more decorum, and a bit less... desperation."

"I am Lord Valerius," the man hissed, glancing over his shoulder at the door as if expecting the Devil himself to walk in. "Of House Vane. I require an escort. Immediately."

Kaelen raised an eyebrow. House Vane was a minor noble house, mostly known for vineyards and squabbling over trade tariffs in the southern provinces. Not exactly high-stakes players in the grand scheme of Eldorian politics. "It’s late, Lord Valerius. The roads aren't safe at night. Especially not for someone dressed like a peacock. You stand out like a lighthouse in a bog."

"I will pay you double your usual rate," Valerius said, dropping a heavy pouch onto the table. It clinked with the distinct, heavy sound of gold. "Triple, if we leave within the hour. I must reach the capital, Arcanis. It is a matter of life and death."

Kaelen looked at the pouch, then at the man’s eyes. They were wide, pupil-dilated with terror. Sweat beaded on his forehead despite the chill in the air. This wasn't just impatience; it was flight.

"Who's chasing you?" Kaelen asked quietly, his hand drifting inches from his hilt. "And don't lie to me, Valerius. Dead men don't pay triple."

"Bandits," Valerius lied. It was a bad lie. "Just bandits. But they are persistent. They... they want to ransom me."

Kaelen sighed. He should say no. He should finish his drink, maybe take Mara up on her offer, go upstairs to his rented room, and sleep until noon. But his purse was light, and the tension in the air made him restless. Besides, if "bandits" were chasing a minor lord with this much fear, it was something interesting. And Kaelen had a bad habit of chasing interesting things.

"Triple," Kaelen said, standing up. He grabbed his cloak from the back of the chair, swinging it over his shoulders. "And you do exactly what I say. If I tell you to run, you run. If I tell you to hide in a ditch, you embrace the mud. If I tell you to play dead, you stop breathing. Understood?"

Valerius nodded vigorously, relief flooding his face. "Yes, yes, anything. Just get me to Arcanis. Please."

***

## Part 2: The Whispering Woods

The road out of Oakhaven was swallowed by the dense forest of the Whispering Woods. The trees here were ancient, their branches interlocking overhead to blot out the moonlight, leaving the path in a tunnel of shadows. The air was cool and smelled of pine needles and damp earth.

Kaelen walked a few paces ahead of Valerius’s horse—a fine mare that looked as exhausted as its rider. Kaelen’s senses were dialed up to eleven. The forest was too quiet. No crickets, no night birds. Just the soft thud of hooves and the lord’s ragged breathing.

"Keep it down," Kaelen murmured, without looking back. "You're breathing like a bellows. Sound carries in these woods."

"I... I apologize," Valerius stammered, wiping sweat from his brow. "It's just... are we safe here? I feel like... like eyes are watching us."

"No," Kaelen said simply. "We're not safe until we're behind the walls of Arcanis. And even then, safety is a relative term. Walls keep armies out, but they don't stop knives in the dark."

Valerius shifted in his saddle. "You speak with a lot of gloom for a young man. You sound like a veteran of a hundred wars. What is your name?"

"Kaelen."

"Just Kaelen? No family name? No lineage?"

"Not one that matters anymore." Kaelen scanned the tree line. The darkness seemed to ripple. Not wind. Movement. He slowed his pace.

"I have something," Valerius whispered, his voice pitching up, unable to handle the silence. "Something important. That is why they chase me. It isn't just gold. It isn't a ransom."

Kaelen stopped. He held up a hand. "Quiet."

"It's a letter," Valerius continued, the words spilling out like vomit. "Proof. The neighboring kingdom, Aridia... everyone thinks they are preparing to invade the southern border. But they aren't. It's a lie. There are agents. Inside our borders. They are faking attacks. They are..."

Kaelen spun around, his blue eyes locking onto the noble. "I said quiet."

*Snap.*

The sound of a twig breaking was deliberate. It came from everywhere and nowhere.

Kaelen drew his longsword in a fluid motion, the steel hissing against the leather scabbard. "Get off the horse," he ordered, his voice low and hard. "Now."

"What?"

"They're here. The horse is a target. It's panic will get you killed. Get down!"

Before Valerius could move, three shadows detached themselves from the darkness. They didn't move like bandits. Bandits were sloppy; they yelled, they postured, they wanted you to be afraid so you'd give up the coin. These figures moved like smoke, silent and fluid. They wore tight-fitting black leather and masks that covered their faces entirely.

*Assassins.*

One lunged for the horse, a dagger flashing with a sickly green coating. Poison. Kaelen was already moving. He intercepted the strike, his longsword clashing against the dagger with a shower of sparks. The force of the blow surprised him; the assassin was strong, unnaturally so, as if their muscles were enhanced by magic.

"Run!" Kaelen shouted to Valerius, parrying a second strike and kicking the assassin in the chest.

Valerius fell from the saddle with a yelp and scrambled into the underbrush, his fine cloak catching on thorns.

Two more assassins bypassed Kaelen, heading straight for the noble. They ignored the horse, ignored Kaelen. Their target was singular.

"Oh no you don't," Kaelen growled. He reached for his second blade, the shorter one. As his hand closed around the hilt, a familiar surge of adrenaline flooded his veins. The world seemed to slow down. The details became sharper—the stitching on the assassin's boot, the slight intake of breath before a strike.

*System Alert: Combat Mode Engaged.*
*Enemy Analysis: Humanoid (Enhanced). Threat Level: High.*
*Adrenaline Surge: +20% Reflexes.*
*Skill Activated: Twin Fang Stance.*

It was a strange sensation, one he had felt since he was a child. He saw the world in numbers, in vectors. While others saw a sword swing, he saw the trajectory, the speed, and the calculated durability of the blade. It was a gift, or perhaps a curse, that allowed him to survive where veterans fell.

He could see the health bars—faint, red lines hovering over his enemies—though he never spoke of it. To speak of such things would be to invite the asylum. But right now, those bars were full, and his job was to empty them.

*Dual Wield.*

He drew the second sword and spun, a whirlwind of steel. He slashed the hamstring of the first assassin, the blade biting deep through leather and flesh. The assassin didn't scream; he just collapsed. Kaelen pivoted on his heel to intercept the two chasing Valerius.

The leading assassin turned, surprised by Kaelen's speed. Kaelen didn't give him time to adjust. He feinted high with the longsword, a classic Eldorian dueling opener, then drove the short sword into the gap in the assassin's armor under the armpit. The man crumpled without a sound.

But there were more. More shadows dropping from the trees. Four, five... seven of them. They landed silently, forming a semi-circle.

"Elite agents," Kaelen muttered, taking a defensive stance between the assassins and the cowering noble. "For a minor lord? You must have one hell of a letter, Valerius. This is a royal guard level hit squad."

The assassins didn't speak. They attacked in unison.

It was a dance of death. Kaelen’s blades were a blur. He deflected a sword thrust, ducked under a swinging chain, and riposted with a slash across a throat. His style was unorthodox—a blend of rigid knightly training and the fluid, dirty fighting of a mercenary. He used the environment, kicking dirt into eyes, backing against a tree to prevent being surrounded.

*Parry. Riposte. Dodge. Slash.*

He was in the zone. But they were disciplined. They rotated, attacking in waves to wear him down. When one fell back to recover stamina, another took his place.

One assassin managed to slip past his guard, the tip of a poisoned blade grazing Kaelen’s cheek. It burned like fire.

*Status Effect: Poison. Health draining slowly.*

Kaelen grunted, stepping back, wiping the blood with his sleeve. "Valerius, keep moving! Don't stop!"

But as he glanced back, his heart sank.

A massive figure had emerged from the shadows behind the noble. It wasn't human. It stood seven feet tall, clad in armor that seemed to be made of fused bone. A helm with jagged horns obscured its face, and a dark mist rolled off its shoulders.

A Demon? No, the Demon King was a myth, a bedtime story. But the aura radiating from this warrior was pure malice. It felt like standing next to an open grave.

Valerius screamed as the dark warrior lifted him by the throat with one hand, lifting him off the ground effortlessly.

"Give it to me," the warrior demanded, his voice like grinding stones.

"I... I don't..." Valerius choked, his legs kicking uselessly.

Kaelen roared, abandoning his defensive position. He charged the remaining assassins, cutting a path through them with reckless fury. "Let him go!"

The dark warrior looked at Kaelen, dismissing him as a threat. He tightened his grip. There was a sickening crunch. Valerius went limp.

"No!" Kaelen skidded to a halt, breathing heavily. The assassins circled him, wary now.

The warrior dropped the body and began to search it. He ripped open Valerius’s tunic.

"Empty," the warrior growled. He turned his helmeted gaze toward Kaelen. Or rather, toward the pouch Valerius had dropped during his scramble—the pouch Kaelen had kicked behind a tree root earlier to keep it safe during the fight.

Kaelen realized the letter wasn't on the body. Valerius had hidden it.

The warrior pointed a gauntleted finger at Kaelen. "Kill the witness. Find the document."

The assassins surged forward.

Kaelen gritted his teeth. He was good, but he wasn't 'kill a squad of elites and a seven-foot monster' good. Not yet.

He looked at Valerius’s body, then at the dark forest behind him. He needed to survive. He needed to warn someone.

He grabbed a small pouch from his belt—flash powder. A trick he’d learned from a gnome alchemist in Kharaz'Mar. He smashed it against the ground.

A blinding flash of magnesium white light erupted, searing the dark-adjusted eyes of his enemies.

Kaelen didn't wait. He grabbed the satchel Valerius had been clutching—which had fallen near the tree—and sprinted into the dense undergrowth.

"Find him!" the warrior roared, the sound shaking the leaves.

Kaelen ran. He ran until his lungs burned and his legs felt like lead. He didn't stop until the sounds of pursuit faded into the distance.

## Part 3: The Message

Morning broke with a gray, dreary light filtering through the canopy. Kaelen sat with his back against a mossy boulder, miles from the road. He was exhausted, bleeding from a dozen small cuts, and his cheek throbbed where the poisoned blade had grazed him. He had treated it with a basic antidote from his kit, but it still stung.

He looked at the object in his lap. It was a scroll case, sealed with the wax crest of House Vane.

He broke the seal and unrolled the parchment.

The text was coded, but Kaelen recognized the cipher. It was a simple military substitution code used by Eldorian border patrols. He had learned it years ago.

As he deciphered the words, his blood ran cold.

*To High Command,*

*The movements in the South are a distraction. Aridia has not mobilized. The attacks on the villages are being orchestrated by our own... no, not ours. Shadows. They wear our uniforms. They burn our crops. They are manufacturing a war.*

*But it is worse. I have seen them. Creatures that serve no king. They are gathering at the Void Rifts. The seals are weakening.*

*The War is not the goal. The Death is the goal. They need the bodies. They need the sorrow.*

*They are feeding Him.*

Kaelen rolled the parchment back up, his hands trembling slightly.

"Feeding Him," he whispered. The Demon King.

It was madness. The Demon King had been dead for a thousand years. But the warrior he had seen... the coordinated precision of the assassins...

He was just a mercenary. He swung swords for coin. He didn't sign up for saving the world.

But he remembered Valerius’s face. The fear. The man had died trying to get this message out.

Kaelen stood up, wincing as his muscles protested. He sheathed his swords.

"Arcanis," he said to the empty forest. "I guess I'm going to the capital after all."

He checked his gear. He had food for two days. The capital was three days away on foot if he pushed it. And he would have to push it. Those things—whatever they were—would be hunting him.

He cast one last look back the way he came.

"Well, Kaelen," he muttered, adjusting his cloak. "You wanted a job that wasn't boring. Congratulations."

He began to walk, his silhouette fading into the mist. The game had begun, and he had just been dealt a hand he couldn't fold.

***

## Part 4: The City of Light and Shadows

**Two Days Later - The Outskirts of Arcanis**

The capital of Eldoria was a sight to behold, even for a cynic like Kaelen. Huge white walls rose from the plains, shimmering with faint protective enchantments. Towers pierced the sky, connected by floating bridges of marble and magic. It was a city of light, a testament to human achievement.

But to Kaelen, right now, it looked like a trap.

He had avoided the main roads, sticking to game trails and farm paths. He had sensed eyes on him twice—shadows that moved against the wind—but he had managed to lose them. His skills as a tracker were rusty, but they held.

He reached the outer slums, a sprawling shantytown that clung to the base of the massive city walls like barnacles on a ship. Here, the magic didn't shine so bright. It smelled of unwashed bodies, roasting meat, and desperation. The buildings were cobbled together from scrap wood and stolen stone, a stark contrast to the gleaming marble above.

Perfect cover.

Kaelen pulled his hood low. He needed information. He needed to know who to trust. If the letter was right, the enemy was already inside the military. He couldn't just walk up to the castle gates.

He needed a drink.

He found a tavern that looked even worse than the 'Rusty Blade'. The sign above the door depicted a headless chicken and was titled, appropriately, 'The Severed Cock'.

Kaelen pushed inside. The noise hit him like a physical wall—shouting, laughter, the clatter of dice. It was packed. Soldiers, travelers, thieves, and whores mingled in a haze of smoke.

He found a corner table in the shadows and ordered a tankard of mead. He needed to think.

As he sipped, he scanned the room. Old habits.

His eyes landed on a table near the center. It was the source of most of the noise.

A massive, hulking figure sat there, devouring an entire roasted boar leg with gusto. He had patches of red scales on his arms and face, and two small horns poking out of his forehead. A Drakorian. Rare to see one this far north. He was dressed in mismatched armor, pieces of plate mixed with leather, as if he had looted a battlefield store.

"More!" the Drakorian boomed, slamming an empty flagon onto the table, splintering the wood. "This tiny cup is an insult to my thirst! I require a barrel!"

Across from him sat an Elf. But not the ethereal, distant kind Kaelen was used to seeing in paintings. This one had her boots up on the table, leaning back in her chair with a dangerous grace. She had vibrant green hair braided back, and emerald eyes that sparkled with mischief. She was tossing peanuts into the Drakorian's open mouth with terrifying accuracy.

"Easy, scale-brain," the Elf laughed, her voice melodic but sharp. "You're going to drink the landlord out of business. And we still haven't paid for the roof you broke."

"The roof was weak!" the Drakorian argued, bits of pork flying. "It could not withstand my sneeze! It was structural negligence!"

Kaelen snorted into his drink. A Dragon Prince and an Elven exile? Walking into a human bar? They were either incredibly powerful or incredibly stupid.

The tavern door banged open.

Kaelen stiffened. Four city guards walked in. But something was off. Their uniforms were correct—blue and gold tabards of the City Watch—but their eyes... they were cold. Focused.

They weren't looking for a drunk dragon. They were scanning the room.

One of the guards' gazes swept over the crowd and locked onto Kaelen in the corner.

Kaelen cursed under his breath. They had found him fast. Too fast. They must have trackers or magic sensing the letter.

The guard tapped his comrade and pointed.

Kaelen stood up slowly. He checked his escape routes. The back door was blocked by a group of gamblers. The front was blocked by the guards.

"Trouble?"

Kaelen looked down. The serving girl—a different one this time, younger, with a nervous tic—was collecting his empty mug.

"Looks like it," Kaelen said. "Sorry about the mess I'm about to make."

He looked back at the center table. The Drakorian and the Elf were still arguing.

"I bet I can hit the barmaid from here," the Elf said, holding a peanut.

"You will miss," the Drakorian grunted. "Your aim is skewed by the wine."

The Elf flicked the peanut. It soared through the air... and bounced off the helmet of the lead guard just as he was drawing his sword to advance on Kaelen.

The guard stopped, blinking. He looked at the peanut on the floor, then at the Elf.

"Who threw that?" the guard barked, his hand going to his hilt.

The Elf froze. She slowly lowered her leg from the table. "Uh... he did." She pointed at the Drakorian.

The Drakorian blinked. "I did not! I am eating! Why would I waste sustenance?"

The guard, already on edge and looking for a fight, marched over to the dragon-man. "You think this is funny, lizard?"

The tavern went silent. Calling a Drakorian a 'lizard' was like calling a thunderstorm a 'drizzle'. It was technically related, but vastly underestimating the lethality.

The Drakorian stood up. He kept standing up. He towered over the guard, seven feet of muscle and scales. Smoke curled from his nostrils.

"Lizard?" he rumbled, his voice dropping to a dangerous growl.

Kaelen watched, his hand relaxing from his sword hilt. Chaos. Chaos was a ladder, or so they said. But right now, chaos was a distraction.

"I am Drakon, Son of Pyroth!" the dragon roared. "And I demand an apology! Or I shall eat your helmet!"

"Get him!" the guard shouted, forgetting about Kaelen for a moment.

The bar erupted.

Drakon flipped the heavy oak table with one hand, sending drinks and food flying. The Elf, Lyra, vaulted over the bar, laughing maniacally as she started grabbing bottles of expensive wine.

Kaelen used the confusion. He slipped into the crowd, moving towards the back door.

But as he passed the brawl, a body came flying at him. He sidestepped, and a guard crashed into the wall where he had been standing a second ago.

Kaelen looked up. The lead guard—the one with the cold eyes—wasn't fighting the dragon. He was cutting through the crowd, straight for Kaelen.

"You cannot hide, carrier," the guard hissed, raising a sword that glowed with a faint, purple light. Shadow magic.

Kaelen drew his blades. "I really hate this city," he muttered.

The guard lunged. Kaelen parried, the impact jarring his arm. This wasn't a normal guard. Another agent.

They traded blows in the middle of the bar fight. Around them, patrons were punching each other, Drakon was using a bench as a club to bat away other guards, and Lyra was taking potshots with a crossbow she had produced from nowhere.

"A little help?" Kaelen shouted, ducking a lethal swing that took a chunk out of a support pillar.

Lyra looked over from behind the bar. She saw the purple glow of the guard's sword. Her eyes narrowed. "Shadow magic? In a pub? Tacky."

She leveled her crossbow. *Thwip.*

A bolt took the guard in the shoulder. He didn't even flinch. He just kept coming at Kaelen.

"Tough guy," Lyra noted. She looked at Drakon. "Hey! Scales! The shiny man is hurting the broody one!"

Drakon turned, holding a struggling patron by the ankle. "What?"

"Smash him!"

Drakon looked at the guard attacking Kaelen. "He has no honor! Attacking a man while he is distracted!"

Drakon tossed the patron aside and charged. He hit the guard like a runaway siege engine. The guard flew across the room, smashing through the front window and out into the street.

Kaelen lowered his swords, breathing hard. He looked at Drakon, then at Lyra.

"Thanks," he said.

"Don't mention it," Lyra hopped over the bar, stuffing a bottle of vintage wine into her pack. "But you owe me a drink. And maybe an explanation as to why the city watch wants to turn you into a shish kebab."

Sirens began to wail in the distance. Real guards were coming.

"We should go," Kaelen said.

"Agreed," Drakon said, picking up a roast chicken from the floor and dusting it off. "This establishment has poor service."

The three of them looked at the door, then at each other.

"Lead the way, broody," Lyra grinned.

Kaelen sighed. He had gone from a solo stealth mission to teaming up with a walking natural disaster and a kleptomaniac elf.

"Follow me," Kaelen said, kicking the back door open.

They ran into the night, the fires of the future war already kindling at their heels.
