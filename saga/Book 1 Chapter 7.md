# Chapter 7: Calm Before the Storm

## Prologue: The General's Diary

*Location: Tent of General Marcus, Valley of Kings*
*Time: Three Weeks After the Summit*

*The men are restless. We have been camped here for weeks, staring at the fog in the valley. The enemy does not show himself. It is a waiting game, and I hate waiting. The silence is not peaceful; it is heavy, like the air before a lightning strike.*

*The 'Alliance' holds, barely. It is a patchwork quilt of hatred stitched together with fear. The Elves complain about the Orcs' hygiene, claiming the smell of cured leather and musk offends their delicate senses. The Orcs complain about the Elves' singing, calling it 'wailing ghosts'. The Dwarves just drink and complain about everything—the beer is too warm, the ground is too soft, the sky is too high.*

*But there is hope. The 'Heroes'—Kaelen and his motley crew—have become something of a legend in the camp. They train with the men. They eat with them. They are the glue. Kaelen fights like a demon but speaks like a man. The Dragonborn eats enough for a platoon but has a laugh that shakes the earth. And the Elf rogue... she has fleeced half my officers at cards, but they love her for it.*

*I only fear that glue will melt when the fire starts. And the fire is coming. I can smell the sulfur on the wind.*

## Part 1: The Training Grounds

*Location: Alliance Forward Base, Sector 4*
*Time: Mid-Morning*

The clatter of wooden swords filled the air, a rhythmic percussion to the symphony of grunts and curses. Dust rose in choking clouds, turning the golden sunlight into a hazy brown fog.

Kaelen stood in the center of the sparring ring, shirtless, sweat glistening on his scars. Each scar told a story—a bandit's knife in Arcanis, a wolf's bite in the Winterlands, the burn from the Shadow Captain's blade. He breathed steadily, his chest rising and falling in a controlled rhythm.

He was facing three opponents at once: an Eldorian Knight named Sir Rylan, an Orc Berzerker named Ghor, and an Elven bladedancer named Elara.

"Come on!" Kaelen taunted, spinning his training blades. The wood hummed through the air. "Is that all the Alliance has to offer? My grandmother hits harder, and she's been dead for ten years!"

Ghor roared, a sound like a bear waking up from hibernation. He charged, swinging a massive wooden club that was essentially a tree trunk.

"Too slow," Kaelen critiqued.

He sidestepped, moving inside the Orc's guard. He hooked his foot behind Ghor's ankle and pushed. The massive warrior went down with a thud that shook the ground.

*System Alert: Evasion Successful.*

Sir Rylan seized the opening. He swung a heavy overhead blow, a textbook 'Knight's Hammer'. It was powerful but predictable.

Kaelen caught the wooden blade with his crossed swords. The impact jarred his arms, but he held firm. With a grunt of effort, he twisted his hips, redirecting the knight's momentum. Rylan stumbled past him.

Elara was faster. She didn't charge; she flowed. She darted in, aiming for his ribs with a thrust that was almost invisible.

*System Alert: Attack Incoming. Trajectory: Left Flank. Speed: High.*

Kaelen didn't look. He trusted his instincts. He ducked, letting the blade pass inches over his head. As he dropped, he swept his leg in a wide arc.

Elara jumped over the sweep, landing lightly on her feet. She was good.

"Finally," Kaelen grinned. "A challenge."

He dropped one sword and switched to a single-handed stance. "Dance with me, elf."

Elara smiled, a predatory expression. "Gladly, human."

They clashed. Wood met wood in a flurry of strikes. *Clack-clack-clack.* They moved across the ring, trading blows and blocks. It was less a fight and more a high-speed chess match.

"Your guard is high," Kaelen said, blocking a strike to his head.

"Your stance is wide," Elara retorted, kicking at his knee.

Kaelen absorbed the kick, grunting. He feinted a thrust to her face, then dropped low and tapped her stomach with his blade.

"Dead," he whispered.

Elara froze. She looked down at the blade pressing against her tunic.

"Again?" she asked, breathless.

"Dead. Dead. And... mostly dead," Kaelen pointed at Ghor, who was trying to get up, shaking his head to clear the stars.

Applause broke out from the soldiers watching on the fence. It started slow, then grew into a roar. Humans, Orcs, and Elves cheering together.

"Again!" Ghor roared, scrambling to his feet. "I want a rematch!"

"No rematches yet," Kaelen said, sheathing his training sword. "Now, we escalate. Team battle."

He pointed to the crowd. "You, you, and you. Join Ghor. You three, join Elara. Rylan, take the rookies."

"What are we playing?" Rylan asked, dusting off his armor.

"Capture the Flag," Kaelen grinned. "But with magic. And traps. And Lyra."

Lyra groaned from the fence. "Do I have to?"

"You're the target," Kaelen said. "If they catch you, I buy drinks tonight. If you evade them for ten minutes, they run laps."

"Ooh, stakes," Lyra hopped down. "I like stakes."

The exercise was chaos. Elara's team used speed, darting through the obstacles Kaelen had set up. Ghor's team just smashed through them. Rylan's team formed a defensive phalanx.

But Lyra was a ghost. She used *Shadow Step*, blinking between cover. She set tripwires made of twine. She threw smoke bombs.

At one point, Ghor thought he had her cornered against the wall.

"Gotcha, tiny elf!"

Lyra smirked. "Look up."

Drakon was sitting on the wall, eating a melon. He dropped the rind on Ghor's head.

"Distraction!" Lyra yelled, sliding between Ghor's legs and tagging him with a chalk bag. "You're dead, big guy."

"This is cheating!" Ghor complained.

"This is war," Kaelen corrected, watching from the sidelines. "War isn't fair. The Demons won't duel you. They will flank you, blind you, and eat you. You have to be ready for anything."

He walked among them, correcting stances.

"Elara, stop telegraphing your strikes. Your eyes give you away."

"Rylan, loosen up. You're stiff. Armor protects you, but mobility saves you."

"Ghor... keep being scary. But maybe look behind you once in a while."

By the end of the session, the squad was exhausted, covered in chalk and dust, but they were smiling. They were a team.

"That was... invigorating," Elara panted, wiping sweat from her brow. "In Sylvanaria, we train in silence. We meditate on the blade. This... chaos... it is effective."

"It's how you stay alive in a tavern brawl," Kaelen said, handing her a waterskin. "Or a demon ambush."

Ghor was laughing, slapping Rylan on the back hard enough to rattle his teeth. "You moved well, tin man! You blocked my charge!"

"I think you dislocated my shoulder," Rylan winced, but he was grinning. "But I didn't fall."

"Why do you fight, human?" Ghor asked, sitting down heavily. "You are small. You break easy."

"I fight so my family doesn't have to," Rylan said quietly. "I have a daughter in the capital. She wants to be a painter."

Ghor nodded solemnly. "I fight for the hoard. Not gold. The hoard of stories. My ancestors watch me. If I die bravely, they sing my name. If I die running, they turn their backs."

"And you, Elf?" Ghor looked at Elara.

"I fight for the silence," she said. "The demons are loud. Their corruption is a noise that never stops. I want the world to be quiet again."

They looked at Kaelen.

"And you, Commander?" Rylan asked. "Why do you fight?"

Kaelen looked at his wooden sword. "I fight because I'm good at it. And because if I don't, no one else will."

"A simple answer," Elara noted. "But a heavy one."

"Show off," Lyra called out, wiping chalk from her face. "You made them run laps anyway."

"Cardio is important," Kaelen shrugged.

"The General wants you. War Council. Again."

"Again?" Kaelen groaned. "We went over the supply lines yesterday. We have enough grain for a month, assuming Drakon doesn't raid the larder."

"It's not supplies," Lyra's face went serious, the playfulness vanishing. "Scouts found something. Or rather... someone."

***

## Part 2: The Gilded Cage

Kaelen entered the Command Tent. The air inside was stale, smelling of old wax and nervous sweat. The map table was crowded. Elfiria was there, looking regal in her white robes, but the circles under her eyes were dark bruises against her pale skin. General Marcus paced like a caged tiger. High Chieftain Grok sat sharpening his axe, the *scritch-scritch* sound grating on everyone's nerves.

"Kaelen," Elfiria nodded, relief washing over her face for a brief moment. "We have a situation."

She pointed to the map. A section of the valley, near the old ruins of a fortress from the Second Era. It was deep in the fog zone.

"A patrol went missing here last night," General Marcus said, his voice tight. "Twelve good men. Rangers. We found them this morning. Flayed."

Kaelen stiffened. The image of the Shadow Captain's work flashed in his mind. "Demons."

"Worse," Grok growled, testing the edge of his axe. "A message was carved into their chests. One letter on each man. 'T-H-E-K-I-N-G-C-O-M-E-S'."

A chill went through the room.

"They are taunting us," Elfiria said, her voice steady but her hands gripping the table edge until her knuckles were white. "Trying to provoke a premature attack."

"It's working," Marcus slammed his fist on the table. "My men want blood! We cannot sit here while they butcher our brothers! They are hanging the bodies from the old walls, Kaelen. In plain sight."

"If we march into the fog, we die," Kaelen said, his voice cutting through the emotion. "That's what they want. They have the terrain advantage. They have the numbers. And they have generals we haven't even seen yet."

"So we do nothing?" Marcus challenged, his face flushing red. "We watch them desecrate our dead?"

"We wait for the Sword Saint," Kaelen said firmly. "Aric is two days away. When he arrives, we have a spearhead. Aric can clear the fog. He can break their lines. Until then... we hold. We strengthen the perimeter. We double the watch."

"Cowardice," Marcus spat.

"Strategy," Kaelen corrected calmly. "Dead heroes don't save kingdoms, General. They just make sad songs."

Grok laughed, a guttural bark. "The human has a point. An Orc rushes to death, but he does not rush to stupidity. We need to know their numbers. Their disposition."

"Our scrying spells are blocked," Elfiria said. "A shroud of dark magic covers the ruins. We are blind."

"Then we need eyes on the ground," Kaelen said. "Small teams. Infiltrators. Not an army."

"I can send my Shadow Dancers," Elara offered. "They can move unseen."

"And my Earth-Shakers can tunnel," Grok added. "We come from below."

"Good," Kaelen nodded. "We pincer them. We create confusion. But we do not engage the main force until Aric arrives. Is that understood?"

Marcus gritted his teeth. He hated taking orders from a mercenary, but he respected the logic. "Agreed. But if they attack..."

"If they attack, we bleed them for every inch," Kaelen promised.

The meeting adjourned in a foul mood. Marcus stormed out to yell at his captains. Grok went to find food.

Kaelen stayed behind with Elfiria. The silence stretched between them.

"You look like you haven't slept in a week," Kaelen said gently, walking around the table to stand beside her.

"I dream of fire," she admitted, rubbing her temples. "Every time I close my eyes, I see the Spire burning. I see my people falling. Kaelen... I'm scared."

"Good," Kaelen said. "Fear keeps you sharp. Only fools are fearless."

"I don't want to be sharp," she whispered, her voice cracking. "I want to be... just Elfiria. Not the High Priestess. Not the Savior. Just... me."

She looked at him. The tent was empty. The guards were outside. The noise of the camp faded into a dull roar.

"Take a walk with me," she said. "Please. I need to see the sky. I need to remember what we're fighting for."

***

## Interlude: The Spy

*Location: A Supply Wagon*
*Time: Same Moment*

The stable boy, a scrawny lad named Tim, was brushing a horse. He looked normal. He smelled of manure and straw.

But his eyes were black. Not the iris, but the soul.

He watched Kaelen and Elfiria leave the tent. He watched the way they walked, close but not touching.

"The bond strengthens," Tim whispered to himself. But it was not his voice. It was the Whispering Shadow's.

He pulled a small, black stone from his pocket.

"The target is vulnerable," he spoke into the stone. "The General is angry. The Orc is distracted. The Priestess is... emotional."

The stone vibrated.

*"Good,"* a voice replied from the void. *"Strike tonight. Malakor is hungry."*

Tim smiled. He went back to brushing the horse, humming a tune that sounded like screams.

***

## Part 3: The Balcony of Stars

They walked to a cliff overlooking the camp. It was a secluded spot, a natural balcony of stone jutting out over the valley. The sun was setting, painting the sky in violent hues of orange and purple, bleeding into the encroaching night. The wind carried the scent of pine and distant campfires, masking the smell of rot from the valley floor.

"It's beautiful," Elfiria said, leaning against the railing. "If you ignore the army of monsters waiting in the dark."

"Perspective is everything," Kaelen leaned against a tree, watching her. The dying light caught the silver in her hair, turning it into a halo. She looked ethereal, a creature of light trapped in a world of mud.

"Kaelen," Elfiria turned to him. "If we lose..."

"We won't."

"If we do. I want you to know..." She stepped closer. The air between them shifted, charged with something heavier than war. It was a magnetic pull, undeniable and terrifying.

"I never wanted to be a leader," she confessed, her voice trembling. "I was the third child. I was supposed to study magic and eat lemon cakes in the solar. I wasn't supposed to lead armies. I wasn't supposed to send men to die."

"You're doing a good job," Kaelen said softly.

"Am I?" She looked down at her hands, as if expecting to see blood on them. "I feel like a fraud. Everyone looks at me and sees the High Priestess. The Symbol. But inside... I'm just a girl who doesn't want to die."

"That's why you're a good leader," Kaelen stepped closer, invading her personal space. He could smell her perfume—jasmine and ozone. "Because you know the cost. Marcus sees pieces on a board. You see people. You mourn them."

Elfiria looked up. Her violet eyes were wide, vulnerable. "And what do you see, Kaelen? When you look at me, do you see the crown? Or the fraud?"

"I see the woman who stood up to a council of wizards," Kaelen said, reaching out to tuck a strand of hair behind her ear. His fingers brushed her skin, sending a jolt through them both. "I see the woman who walked into a war zone because it was right. I see the woman who saved my life in the woods."

He let his hand linger on her cheek. Her skin was cool, soft as silk.

"I see Elfiria," he whispered.

Her breath hitched. She leaned into his touch, closing her eyes.

"Kaelen..."

"Elfiria."

She opened her eyes. The longing in them was raw, undisguised. It burned brighter than her magic.

"Make me forget," she whispered. "Just for a moment. Make me forget the war. Make me forget the dead."

Kaelen didn't hesitate. He pulled her to him.

Their lips met.

It wasn't the chaste, courtly kiss of a knight and a princess. It was the desperate, hungry kiss of two people standing on the edge of oblivion. It was a kiss of survival.

Elfiria made a small sound in her throat and wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him down. Her fingers tangled in his hair, desperate to hold on. Kaelen's hands found her waist, pulling her flush against him. He could feel the rapid beat of her heart against his chest, matching his own.

The world fell away. There was no army. No demons. No duty. Just the warmth of her body, the taste of wine and honey on her lips, and the soft sighs she made as he deepened the kiss.

He walked her back, pressing her gently against the trunk of the ancient oak tree. She gasped as his lips moved to her jawline, then her neck.

"Kaelen," she breathed, her head falling back. "If we survive this..."

"When," he corrected, nipping lightly at the sensitive skin beneath her ear.

"When we survive this," she shivered. "Take me away. Anywhere. Just... away. Show me the ocean. I've never seen the ocean."

"I will," Kaelen promised. He kissed her again, slower this time, savoring the moment. "I'll show you everything."

For a long time, there was only the sound of the wind and their ragged breathing.

Finally, they broke apart. Elfiria's cheeks were flushed a deep violet. Her lips were swollen. She looked... alive. Radiant.

"Better?" Kaelen asked, resting his forehead against hers.

"Much," she smiled, a genuine, dazzling smile that could have lit up the Spire.

"Hey! Lovebirds!"

The voice cut through the air like a serrated knife.

They jumped apart, guilt written on their faces.

Lyra was standing on the path, arms crossed. Her expression was a mask of indifference, but Kaelen saw the tightness in her jaw. The hurt in her eyes.

"Dinner bell," Lyra said flatly. "Drakon ate the first boar. If you want the second one, hurry up. Unless you're planning to survive on love and moonbeams."

Elfiria quickly smoothed her robes and placed her circlet back on her head. The mask of the High Priestess slid back into place, but her eyes remained soft when she looked at Kaelen.

"Thank you, Lyra," Elfiria said, her voice steady. "We are coming."

She hurried back towards the camp, her step lighter than it had been in weeks.

Kaelen stayed for a second. He looked at Lyra.

"Lyra..."

"Don't," she turned away, kicking a stone. "Just don't. Let's go eat."

"You're jealous," Kaelen said, surprised. It wasn't an accusation; it was a realization.

Lyra froze. She turned back, her eyes blazing green fire. "Jealous? No. I'm pragmatic. She's a Princess, Kaelen. You're a merc. It's a cliché. And it ends with you dead or heartbroken. Usually both. I don't want to have to scrape you off the floor when she realizes she needs a political marriage."

"It's not like that."

"Isn't it?" She stepped closer, poking him in the chest. "Just... be careful. She has a kingdom to save. You're just... her guard. Don't forget which side of the tracks you live on. And don't forget who was there when you were bleeding in the mud."

She turned and marched away, her shoulders stiff.

Kaelen watched her go, feeling a pang of guilt. He had gained a lover, but he felt like he was losing a friend.

*System Alert: Relationship Update.*
*Elfiria: Intimacy Level Increased (Lover).*
*Lyra: Jealousy Level Increased. Loyalty: Questionable?*
*Emotional Status: Complicated.*

***

## Part 4: The Banquet of Fools

The mood at the banquet was surprisingly festive. The soldiers, unaware of the grim report about the flayed patrol, were celebrating the arrival of fresh ale supplies from the Dwarven holds. Bonfires roared, and bards sang songs of old victories.

Drakon was the center of attention. He was sitting at a massive table made of reinforced oak, surrounded by empty barrels. He was arm-wrestling an Ogre named Kragg.

"Hnnng!" Kragg strained, veins bulging on his forehead, sweat pouring down his green face. His arm was the size of a tree limb.

"Is that all?" Drakon yawned, taking a sip of ale with his free hand. "My grandmother had a firmer grip."

*SLAM.*

He pinned the Ogre's arm. The table cracked.

"Winner!" the crowd cheered. Coins changed hands.

"Who is next?" Drakon roared, holding up a tankard. "I take all challengers! Even you, tiny Elf!" He pointed at Lyra, who was sulking in the corner.

Lyra ignored him. She was shuffling a deck of cards, her fingers moving in a blur.

"Care for a game, soldier?" she asked a young Sylvanarian archer.

"I... I have no gold," the elf stammered.

"I accept rations, trinkets, and secrets," Lyra smirked.

"Secrets?"

"Sure. Tell me which captain is sleeping with which lieutenant. Tell me where the good wine is hidden. Information is currency."

The elf blushed. "Well... Captain Elara does sneak out to the hot springs at midnight..."

"Sold," Lyra dealt him a card. "Hit or stand?"

By the time the stew arrived, Lyra had won three weeks of rations, a silver locket, and enough gossip to blackmail half the camp.

"Pass," Lyra said to Drakon, pocketing her winnings. She poked at her stew. She was sitting next to Kaelen, but she felt miles away.

"About before..." Kaelen started, leaning in.

"Eat your stew, hero," she muttered. "Before it gets cold. Like your common sense."

"Lyra, look at me."

She sighed and turned to face him. Her green eyes were guarded.

"I didn't choose this," Kaelen said softly. "I didn't ask to be a Commander. I didn't ask for... any of it."

"But you didn't say no," Lyra countered. "And you didn't say no to her."

"Is that what this is about? Jealousy?"

"It's about survival, Kaelen!" she hissed, keeping her voice low so the nearby soldiers wouldn't hear. "You're getting tangled in a web you can't cut your way out of. Elfiria is a good person, maybe. But she's also a Symbol. Symbols get people killed."

"I can handle myself."

"Can you?" She gestured to the room. "Look at this. Banquets. Titles. It's soft. It makes you slow. We survived because we were hungry. Because we were paranoid. Now? You're getting comfortable."

Kaelen looked at the laughing soldiers. At Drakon arm-wrestling. At the warm fire.

"Maybe I am," he admitted. "Is that so bad? To want a moment of peace?"

"Peace is a lie," Lyra said, her voice cracking. "There is only the lull before the next ambush. And when it comes... I don't want you to be looking at the stars. I want you looking at the shadows."

She put her hand on his arm. It was a rare gesture of affection.

"Promise me, Kaelen. When the metal hits the meat, you forget the Princess. You forget the politics. You fight. Like the gutter rat I found in that tavern."

Kaelen covered her hand with his. "I promise."

"Good," she pulled away, masking her emotions again. "Now eat. You're too skinny to be a hero."

"Lyra, I didn't mean to—"

Suddenly, the ground shook.

It wasn't an earthquake. It was an impact.

*BOOM.*

A massive explosion tore through the perimeter wall. Wood and stone flew like shrapnel. A guard tower collapsed, crushing the sentries beneath it.

The music stopped. The laughter died.

"Attack!" a sentry screamed, his voice cut short by a gurgle. "They're inside!"

The main tent flap was ripped open. But it wasn't a soldier.

It was a Demon. A massive, hulking brute with red skin and black iron armor that seemed fused to his flesh. He stood ten feet tall, holding a flaming greatsword.

General Malakor. One of the Seven.

"Did I miss the toast?" Malakor sneered. His voice was like grinding rocks.

Behind him, hundreds of lesser demons poured into the camp—Imps, Hellhounds, and Shadow Stalkers.

"To arms!" Marcus shouted, drawing his sword. "Defend the camp!"

Malakor laughed. He raised a hand, and a wave of Hellfire swept through the tent, incinerating the tables and the soldiers near the entrance.

"Chaos," Malakor breathed, inhaling the smoke of burning flesh. "Delicious."

Kaelen drew his swords. The calm was over. The Storm had broken.

***

## Interlude: The Waiting Game

*Location: The High Road, Two Days March South*
*Time: Moments Before the Attack*

Aric, the Sword Saint, sat on a rock by the side of the road. He was cleaning his blade, *Dawnbringer*. The metal hummed, a low vibration that resonated with his own heartbeat.

"General?" his lieutenant asked. "The men are ready to camp."

Aric didn't answer. He looked north, towards the Valley of Kings.

He felt it. A disturbance in the mana. Like a stone thrown into a still pond. A ripple of malice so pure it tasted like copper on his tongue.

"No," Aric said, sheathing his sword. The *click* of the guard was the only sound in the twilight. "No camp."

"Sir? The men are exhausted. We have marched for ten hours."

"The enemy does not sleep," Aric stood up. He wasn't a large man, but his presence was overwhelming. He radiated an aura of absolute, unshakeable calm. A man who had seen hell and walked out the other side. "And tonight... the enemy feasts."

He climbed onto his white warhorse, *Sun-Chaser*.

"Double time," Aric ordered. "We march through the night."

"But sir, the horses..."

"Run them until they die," Aric said, his eyes cold steel. "Then we walk. If we do not reach the Valley by dawn... there will be no army left to join. And I will not bury another generation."

## Epilogue: The First Strike

*Location: The Main Tent*
*Time: The First Minute*

The explosion had deafened Kaelen. His ears rang. The world was a blur of fire and screaming.

*System Alert: Combat Mode Engaged.*
*Threat Assessment: Extreme.*
*Enemy: General Malakor (Level 50).*

Level 50.

Kaelen froze for a microsecond. He was Level 18. This wasn't a fight; it was an execution.

"Form up!" Marcus screamed, charging the Demon General. "For Eldoria!"

Marcus was Level 35. A veteran. A legend.

He swung his enchanted greatsword, *Lion's Roar*. It glowed with holy light.

Malakor didn't even draw his weapon. He simply backhanded Marcus.

*CRACK.*

The sound of breaking armor was louder than the explosion. Marcus flew across the tent, smashing into the main support pillar. He crumpled, blood leaking from his visor.

*System Alert: Ally Down. General Marcus: Critical Condition.*

"Pathetic," Malakor spat. He looked around the tent. His eyes landed on Elfiria.

"Ah," he smiled, revealing rows of serrated teeth. "The Priestess. The Master has special plans for you."

He took a step towards her. The ground melted where he walked.

"Protect the Princess!" Captain Solas yelled. Ten Royal Guards charged.

Malakor snapped his fingers.

*Spell: Hellfire Nova.*

A ring of black fire expanded from him. It hit the guards. They didn't scream. They just turned to ash. Their armor clattered to the floor, empty and smoking.

Elfiria stood her ground, raising her staff. "I am not afraid of you, monster!"

"You should be," Malakor chuckled.

He reached for her.

"Drakon! Now!" Kaelen yelled.

Drakon, who had been buried under the debris of the arm-wrestling table, burst out. He was holding a barrel of ale.

"Drink this!" Drakon threw the barrel.

Malakor swatted it out of the air. It exploded, soaking him in alcohol.

"Lyra! Fire!"

Lyra was already moving. She fired a fire bolt into the soaked demon.

*WOOSH.*

Malakor was engulfed in flames.

"Did we get him?" Lyra asked, nocking another arrow.

The fire swirled. Malakor stepped out of the inferno. He was laughing. The fire seemed to be healing him, his red skin glowing brighter.

"I was born in fire, little elf," Malakor said. "Is that the best you have?"

Kaelen gripped his swords.

"Run," he whispered to Elfiria. "Get to the Spire. Activate the defenses."

"I won't leave you!"

"Go!" Kaelen pushed her towards the back exit. "We'll buy you time!"

"How much time?" Drakon asked, looking at the indestructible demon.

"Seconds," Kaelen admitted. "If we're lucky."

He looked at the Demon General.

"Hey, Ugly!" Kaelen shouted. "Pick on someone your own size!"

Malakor looked at the small human.

"I see no one of my size," Malakor said. "Only ants."

He raised his flaming sword. The runes on the blade glowed with an unholy light.

*System Analysis: Enemy Weapon.*
*Name: Hell-Cleaver.*
*Attribute: Fire/Darkness.*
*Effect: Area of Effect Damage. Soul Drain.*

"Incoming!" Kaelen yelled, diving to the left.

Malakor brought the sword down.

*BOOM.*

The ground split. A fissure of fire raced towards Kaelen. He rolled, the heat singeing his eyebrows.

"Too slow!" Malakor laughed. He swung horizontally.

The shockwave knocked Kaelen, Lyra, and Drakon off their feet. They tumbled through the debris of the tent.

Kaelen hit the ground hard. His vision swam.

*HP: 65%.*
*Status: Concussed.*

He looked up. Malakor was looming over Elfiria. The Princess had raised a shield of light, but it was cracking under the demon's aura.

"Your light is weak," Malakor sneered. "Let me show you true power."

He raised his fist. Dark energy coalesced around it.

"NO!" Kaelen scrambled to his feet.

The Battle of the Valley had begun. And they were already losing.

*System Alert: Chapter Completed.*
*World State Update: Camp Breached. Surprise Attack. General Marcus Down.*
*Party Status: Combat Active. Survival Probability: 5%.*

**[End of Chapter 7]**
