# Chapter 15: The Unforgiving Light

## Prologue: The King's Decree

*Location: The Floating Fortress (Demon HQ)*
*Time: One Month after the Dome*

The Demon King Azezel looked down at the world. The Dome was a blemish on his perfect darkness.

"They persist," he said.

"The Exiled," a new General reported. "They raided Ironhold. They freed the cattle."

"Let them," Azezel smiled. "Hope makes the meat sweeter."

He turned to the map. "But do not let them rest. Send the Hunters. And... prepare the Ritual."

"The Ritual, sire?"

"The Dome blocks matter," Azezel said. "But it does not block dreams. We will break them from the inside."

## Part 1: The Oath

*Location: Camp Hope (Ruins of Ironhold)*
*Time: Night*

The camp was bustling. Humans and Orcs worked together (mostly).

Kaelen stood on the ramparts. Elfiria joined him.

"We have an army," she said.

"We have a mob," Kaelen corrected. "But they're learning."

"They believe in you, Kaelen."

"They believe in the guy with the glowing swords. If I drop them, they run."

"Then don't drop them."

She took his hand. "We made a choice, Kaelen. To stay out here. To fight in the mud."

"I know."

"I don't regret it."

"Neither do I."

Grok and Lyra joined them. Drakon was down below, teaching kids how to breathe fire (safely-ish).

"We need a name," Lyra said. "For the history books."

"The Exiled is good," Grok grunted.

"The Dawn Guard?" Elfiria suggested.

"No," Kaelen looked at the Dome. It was blindingly bright against the dark sky. "We are the Shadow Walkers. We walk in the dark so they can live in the light."

"A bit dramatic," Lyra smirked. "But I like it."

They drew their weapons.

"To the dark," Kaelen said.

"To the dark!" they chorused.

## Part 2: The New Normal

Life in the Shadow Walkers was hard. They were constantly on the move. Raiding supply trains. Sabotaging portals. Running.

But they were effective. The Demon King's advance had stalled.

Kaelen sat by the fire, cleaning his gear. He was tired. His level had increased, but so had his weariness.

*System Alert:*
*Level 15 Reached.*
*New Skill: Void Resistance (Passive).*

"You should sleep," Lyra said, sitting next to him.

"Can't," Kaelen said. "Nightmares."

"Me too," Lyra admitted. "I dream of spiders. Big ones."

"I dream of falling," Kaelen said. "Falling into the dark."

"Well," Lyra bumped his shoulder. "If you fall, I'll catch you. Or steal your wallet on the way down."

Kaelen laughed. It felt good to laugh.

## Part 3: The Letter

Later that night, Kaelen walked to the edge of the camp.

He felt a vibration. A familiar one.

He took out the Vane Letter. It was glowing.

*Text Update:*
*The Key is not in the Vault. The Key is in the Blood.*

"What?" Kaelen frowned.

"Kaelen?" Elfiria walked up to him. "What is it?"

"The letter changed," Kaelen showed her.

"In the blood?" Elfiria paled. "Kaelen... the Royal Bloodline of Aetheria. We were the guardians of the Vaults."

"You?"

"My blood," she whispered. "I am the Key."

"If the Demon King finds out..."

"He will hunt me," she said. "Not to kill me. But to use me."

Kaelen gripped his sword. "He won't touch you."

"He might not have to," a voice said from the shadows.

## Part 4: The Cliffhanger

Kaelen spun around.

Standing there was a figure in a grey cloak.

"Hello, Kaelen," the figure said.

It was Aric.

But his eyes were black. And his skin was cracked like porcelain.

"Aric?" Kaelen stepped back. "You're dead."

"Death is a doorway," the thing that looked like Aric smiled. "And I have returned. The King sends his regards."

He drew a sword. It was *Dawnbringer*. But the blade was black.

"Book Two begins now," the Dark Saint whispered.

He lunged.

Kaelen drew his swords. Steel met Shadow.

*CLANG.*

The screen faded to black.

*System Alert: Book 1 Complete.*
*Achievement: The End of the Beginning.*
*Next: Book 2 - The Birth of a Fallen Hero.*
