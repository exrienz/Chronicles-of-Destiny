# Chapter 14: The Holy Dome

## Prologue: The Exile

*Location: The Aridian Border, Outside the Dome*
*Time: One Week Later*

The transition from the cool, blue light of the Dome to the harsh, red sun of Aridia was jarring.

Kaelen emerged from a cave mouth, squinting against the glare. The heat hit him like a physical blow.

"It smells like sulfur," Lyra said, climbing out behind him. She coughed, pulling her scarf over her face.

"Home sweet home," Kaelen muttered.

They were in the Badlands. To the north, the Dome rose like a shimmering wall of aurora, touching the clouds. Inside, it was safe. Outside...

Kaelen scanned the horizon. Smoke columns rose from distant villages. Vultures circled.

"The Demon King is angry," Drakon said, squeezing his bulk through the cave opening. "He has lost his favorite chair."

"He's regrouping," Elfiria said. She looked at the Dome with longing. "My people are safe. But I am here."

"You chose to be here," Kaelen reminded her.

"I know," she sighed. "But it still hurts."

## Part 1: The Warlord

They walked for days. They needed supplies. They needed allies.

They found both in the form of an Orc Warband.

They were ambushed in a canyon. Or rather, the Orcs *tried* to ambush them.

"Halt!" A massive Orc jumped from a rock, landing in front of them. "Give us your water and your... hey, is that a Dragon?"

"I am a Dragon Knight!" Drakon roared. "And I do not share water!"

"Wait!" Kaelen stepped forward. "We are looking for Chieftain Grok."

"Grok?" The Orc lowered his axe. "Grok is crazy. He is fighting the Shadow-Men in the north."

"Take us to him."

The camp was a fortress of scrap metal and bone. Grok sat on a throne made of demon skulls (a crude imitation of the King's, but effective).

"You live!" Grok laughed when he saw them. He hugged Drakon, a bone-crushing embrace. "I saw the big light! I thought you blew yourselves up!"

"We blew up the bad guys," Lyra corrected.

"Good! But now the bad guys are here," Grok pointed to the map. "They are everywhere. They are angry."

"We need to unite the tribes," Kaelen said. "Orcs, humans, dwarves. Everyone outside the Dome."

"Humans are weak," Grok spat. "They run."

"We didn't run," Elfiria stepped forward. Her eyes glowed. "We walked into hell to save you."

Grok looked at her. He sniffed. "You smell like ozone. You are the Light-Witch."

He grinned. "Okay. We unite."

## Part 2: The Resistance

Building an army from scraps was hard.

Kaelen and Grok raided demon supply caravans. Lyra trained scouts in stealth. Drakon taught the Orcs how to fight in formation (mostly "stand behind the dragon"). Elfiria set up a triage center, healing the wounded.

They became a legend. "The Exiled."

One night, sitting by the fire, Kaelen looked at his map.

"We are annoying them," Kaelen said. "But we aren't stopping them."

"We need a victory," Grok said. "A real one."

"There is a fortress," Kaelen pointed. "Ironhold. It's a prison camp. Thousands of humans are being held there. Slaves."

"If we free them," Lyra said. "We get an army."

"And if we fail," Elfiria added. "We die."

"Let's do it," Drakon said.

## Part 3: The Jailbreak

Ironhold was a fortress of black steel. It was guarded by a legion of demons.

The plan was simple. Drakon knocks on the front door. Everyone else sneaks in the back.

*BOOM.*

"DELIVERY!" Drakon smashed the front gate with a battering ram.

The demons swarmed him. Grok and his berserkers charged in behind him.

Meanwhile, Kaelen, Lyra, and Elfiria scaled the back wall.

They moved through the prison blocks. The cells were filled with emaciated humans.

"We're here to get you out!" Kaelen shouted, slashing a lock.

"Who are you?" a prisoner asked, shielding his eyes.

"The Exiled," Kaelen said.

They moved fast. Unlocking cells. Arming the prisoners with stolen weapons.

The prison riot turned into a battle. The demons were fighting on two fronts.

The Warden—a massive winged demon—flew down.

"Insects!"

Elfiria blasted him with light. Lyra pinned his wings with bolts. Kaelen finished him with a *Twin Star* cross-slash.

The fortress fell.

As the sun rose, five thousand freed prisoners stood in the courtyard. They looked at Kaelen with awe.

"We are not an army yet," Kaelen told them. "But we will be."
