# Blueprint Updates & Modifications

## Book 1: The Dance of Life and Death

### Chapter 2: Chains of Fate
*   **Modification:** Expanded the "Cell Scene" to include a nightmare sequence detailing the death of Lord Vane. This provides immediate context for Kaelen's trauma and the stakes of the letter.
*   **Modification:** Added a "Truth or Dare" game segment to facilitate organic exposition and relationship building (and erotic tension) between the trio.
*   **New Location:** Specified the layout of the Arcanis Watch Station, including "Interrogation Room 1".
*   **Character Development:** Established Drakon's motivation (Cultural Exchange / Hunger) and Lyra's backstory (Exile due to isolationism).

### Chapter 3: The First Spark
*   **Modification:** Changed the route from "Streets" to "Undercity/Sewers" to add environmental variety and a monster encounter (Sewer Slime).
*   **Modification:** Added a "Safehouse" scene in an abandoned bakery to allow for character downtime and a specific "cleaning up" scene to build romantic tension.
*   **Combat:** Enhanced the final park battle with a mini-boss (Earth Golem) to showcase party synergy.
*   **Lore:** Confirmed the presence of "Malakor" earlier in the narrative to raise the stakes immediately.
