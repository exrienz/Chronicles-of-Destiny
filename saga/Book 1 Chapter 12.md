# Chapter 12: The Rout

## Prologue: The Sleeper Awakes

*Location: Vault 7, The Deep Roads*
*Time: Unknown*

The Vault AI, designated 'Custodian', sensed life signs.

*Analysis: Organic lifeforms detected. Three humanoids. One draconid.*
*Threat Assessment: Low.*
*Status: Engaging Hospitality Protocols.*

Lights flickered on in the dormant facility. Air filtration systems whirred to life.

"Welcome," a disembodied voice echoed through the halls. "It has been 3,452 years since the last visitor. Please wipe your feet."

## Part 1: The Ghost in the Machine

Kaelen jumped, drawing his sword. "Who's there?"

"I am Custodian," the voice replied politely. "I am the caretaker of this facility. You look terrible. Would you like a beverage?"

"A ghost?" Lyra whispered, hiding behind Drakon.

"Construct," Elfiria corrected, staring at a glowing panel on the wall. "An artificial intelligence."

"I prefer 'Synthetic Spirit'," the Custodian noted. "Ghost implies I am dead. I am very much operational."

"Custodian," Kaelen sheathed his sword. "We are refugees. We need shelter."

"Shelter provided," the voice said. "However, unauthorized entry to the Control Sector is prohibited. Please remain in the Lobby."

"Lobby?" Drakon looked around the metal cavern. "This is a lobby?"

"It is a very big lobby," the Custodian agreed.

They set up camp. It was strange. The floor was warm. The air was clean. A machine in the wall dispensed a bland, nutrient-rich paste that Drakon declared "better than goblin."

"This place..." Elfiria ran her hand along a wall. "It's older than the Elven Kingdoms. The magic here... it's pure logic."

"Can it kill demons?" Kaelen asked the question that mattered.

"The facility is a research station," the Custodian answered. "We studied the Void. And how to repel it."

"Repel it?" Kaelen looked up. "How?"

"Project 'Starlight'," the Custodian said. "A weapon designed to cleanse corruption. Unfortunately, the project was never completed. The creators... left."

"Left?"

"Died," the Custodian corrected. "The Void ate them."

## Part 2: The Map Room

"Show us," Kaelen commanded.

"Access restricted," the Custodian said.

"Override," Elfiria stepped forward. She placed her hand on the panel. She channeled her mana—not as a spell, but as a key. She matched the frequency of the crystal.

*Access Granted. Administrator Elfiria recognized.*

"How did you do that?" Lyra asked.

"My bloodline," Elfiria realized. "The High Elves... we are descendants of the Caretakers."

The wall dissolved into a holographic map. It showed the entire continent.

"By the gods," Drakon breathed.

The map showed the corruption. A red stain spreading from the Valley of Kings, covering half the world.

"This is the enemy," Kaelen pointed to the red.

"And this," the Custodian highlighted a blue dot deep beneath the Valley. "Is the Starlight Prototype."

"It's under the Demon King's throne," Lyra realized.

"It is connected to the Geothermal Grid," the Custodian explained. "If activated, it can project a high-frequency mana field. A 'Dome' of light. It would vaporize any Void entity within its radius."

"A nuke," Kaelen used a word he didn't know he knew.

"A shield," Elfiria corrected. "It doesn't just kill them. It keeps them out."

"Can we activate it from here?"

"Negative," the Custodian said. "Manual activation required. The link was severed during the Great Collapse."

"So we have to go back," Kaelen said. "Under the army. Under the King."

"It's suicide," Lyra said. But she was checking her daggers.

"It's the only way," Kaelen looked at the map. "Custodian, is there a tunnel?"

"There is a maintenance shaft," the AI highlighted a thin line. "It leads directly to the crypts beneath the Fortress of Dawn."

"We go in," Kaelen said. "We turn it on. We save the world."

"Or we die trying," Drakon grinned. "I like those odds."

## Part 3: The Training Montage

They stayed in the Vault for a week. They needed to heal. They needed to prepare.

The Custodian opened the armory.

"Jackpot," Lyra whistled.

Rows of weapons. Not steel, but *Starlight Alloy*. Translucent, humming with power.

Kaelen picked up two short swords. They felt weightless.

*System Alert: Weapon Acquired.*
*Name: Twin Stars.*
*Effect: +50% Damage to Void Entities.*

"I'll take these," Kaelen spun them.

Drakon found a shield that could expand into a wall. "Perfect for the hallway."

Lyra found a cloaking cloak. "Now you see me... now you don't."

Elfiria spent her time with the Custodian, learning the activation codes.

"You have to memorize the sequence," the AI instructed. "One mistake, and the core overloads. Then everyone dies."

"No pressure," Elfiria muttered.

Kaelen trained. He fought holographic simulations of Shadow Knights. He practiced the "Intent" reading Aric had taught him.

*Dodge. Strike. Dodge. Strike.*

He was faster. Stronger. The despair of the defeat had hardened into a cold resolve.

"You're ready," Lyra said, watching him.

"We all are," Kaelen said.

He gathered them in the lobby.

"This is a one-way trip," Kaelen said. "Once we activate the Dome, we're stuck. The demons will be outside. We'll be inside. But we'll be alive."

"Let's go," Drakon opened the maintenance hatch.

"Goodbye, Custodian," Elfiria said.

"Good luck, Administrator," the AI replied. "Try not to get eaten."

They descended into the dark.

*System Alert: Chapter Completed.*
*World State Update: Party Re-equipped. Ancient Tech Acquired.*
*New Objective: Infiltrate the Valley.*
