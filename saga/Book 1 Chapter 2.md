# Chapter 2: Chains of Fate

## Part 1: The Weight of Silence

The dungeon of the Arcanis City Watch was a masterclass in sensory deprivation, if the goal was to deprive one of hope, joy, and the ability to breathe through one's nose without gagging. It smelled of wet dog, ancient mildew, and the distinct, coppery tang of regret that seemed to seep from the very stones. The walls were made of damp, weeping rock that glistened in the flickering light of a single, dying torch down the hallway. Every few seconds, a drop of water would fall from the ceiling—*plink*—landing in a puddle that had likely been forming since the First Age.

Kaelen sat on the single, splintered wooden bench that the cell provided, his arms crossed tightly over his chest. He felt phantom weight at his hips—the absence of his swords was a physical ache, a missing limb that left him feeling exposed and irritable. He stared at the rusted iron bars, counting the flakes of corrosion.

*Seven hundred and twelve. Seven hundred and thirteen.*

He closed his eyes, trying to center himself. But his mind, as always, was a chaotic stream of data.

*System Check Initiated.*

The familiar blue text scrolled across the back of his eyelids, a comforting, if intrusive, overlay on reality.

*Status: Detained.*
*Location: Arcanis City Watch - Holding Cell 4B.*
*Health: 85% (Minor bruising on left ribcage, fatigue).*
*Stamina: 60%.*
*Mana: 100% (Dormant).*
*Equipment: None (Confiscated).*
*Party Status:*
  *- Lyra (Rogue): Boredom Level - Critical.*
  *- Drakon (Dragon Knight): Hunger Level - Extreme.*

Kaelen sighed, the breath rattling in his chest. He hated this power sometimes. The "System." It wasn't a gift; it was a curse. While other children saw the beauty of a sunset, Kaelen saw the refraction of light through atmospheric particles. While other warriors felt the thrill of battle, Kaelen saw trajectories, hit probabilities, and health bars. It made him efficient, yes. Deadly, certainly. But it also made him feel... detached. Like a player controlling an avatar rather than a man living a life.

"This is unacceptable!"

Drakon’s voice boomed, shattering Kaelen’s introspection. The sound reverberated off the stone walls like a thunderclap trapped in a bottle. The massive dragon-man stood by the bars, gripping them with hands the size of hams. He shook the metal, and the entire cell door rattled in its frame. Dust and mortar rained down from the ceiling, coating Kaelen’s black hair in grey powder.

"I am a Prince of the Ruby Peaks!" Drakon roared, his voice deep enough to vibrate Kaelen's teeth. "I do not belong in a cage! I belong at a banquet table! I belong on a battlefield! I belong anywhere but here, smelling of unwashed humans and despair!"

Kaelen opened his eyes and brushed the dust from his shoulder with deliberate slowness. "Will you stop shouting? You're going to bring the ceiling down on us. And if you do, the System calculates a 98% chance of us being crushed to death."

"I am not shouting!" Drakon turned, his tail lashing behind him and thumping against the stone floor like a heavy rope. Patches of red scales covered his skin, shimmering in the dim light. Two small horns protruded from his forehead, giving him a demonic appearance that was entirely at odds with his childish temper tantrum. "I am projecting my displeasure! This is a diplomatic incident! My father will burn this city to the ground! Or at least, he will burn the kitchens! The service here is atrocious!"

He kicked a bowl of unrecognizable grey sludge that had been slid into the cell an hour ago. The sludge wobbled threateningly, a gelatinous mass of mystery meat and apathy, but it did not spill. It seemed to defy the laws of physics out of sheer spite.

"You're giving me a headache," a voice drawled from above.

Lyra was hanging upside down from the upper bars of the cell, her legs hooked through the iron with the casual grace of a jungle cat. Her green braid dangled down, swaying slightly like a pendulum. She was examining the lock mechanism with a bored expression, her emerald eyes narrowing as she traced the tumblers. Her leather armor, usually pristine, was smudged with soot from the tavern brawl.

"And for the record, Scales," she continued, her voice light and teasing, "you're in a cage because you threw a guard through a window. A *closed* window. On the second floor. Into a cart of cabbages. I believe the technical term is 'Assault with a Deadly Lizard'."

"He was rude!" Drakon argued, crossing his massive arms. Smoke curled lazily from his nostrils, smelling of sulfur and campfire. "He called me a lizard! It is a slur! A racial epithet! In my culture, calling someone a lizard is grounds for a duel to the death. Or at least a very stern headbutt. I should have eaten his helmet as I promised! It would have been crunchy."

"And now we're here," Kaelen muttered. "In a cell. With no weapons. And my mission is... complicated."

Lyra dropped from the ceiling, landing silently on the balls of her feet. She dusted off her tight leather trousers, which hugged her athletic frame in all the right places, and sauntered over to Kaelen. She moved with a fluid grace that Kaelen couldn't help but admire—her agility score must be through the roof.

"So, Mr. Broody," she grinned, leaning down so her face was inches from his. He could smell her scent—a mix of pine needles, expensive wine, and the ozone smell of magic. It was intoxicating in the dank cell. "You got a name for us yet? Or should I just keep calling you 'The Guy Who Started It'?"

Kaelen looked up at her. Her eyes were green, like the forests of Sylvanaria, but sharp, intelligent. "I didn't start it. I was minding my own business. You two turned a tavern into a war zone."

"Details, details," Lyra waved a hand dismissively. She sat down next to him on the bench, invading his personal space. Her shoulder pressed against his, warm and firm. "I'm Lyra. The large, hungry fireplace over there is Drakon. And you are?"

"Kaelen."

"Just Kaelen? No 'Sir Kaelen of the Stick-in-the-Mud'?"

"Just Kaelen."

"Well, Just Kaelen," she teased, her voice dropping to a husky whisper. She leaned closer, her lips almost brushing his ear. "You have very intense eyes. Has anyone ever told you that? Like you're analyzing my soul. Or undressing me with your mind."

Kaelen felt a flush of heat rise up his neck. *System Alert: Heart Rate Increasing (92 BPM).*

"I'm analyzing the lock," he lied, his voice tight.

Lyra laughed, a melodious sound that seemed out of place in the dungeon. "Liar. But I like it." She leaned back slightly, looking him up and down. "You're not bad looking for a human. A bit scruffy. A bit too serious. But you have nice arms."

Drakon grunted, finally stepping away from the bars. He slumped down onto the floor, the stone groaning under his weight. "Kaelen. A weak name. It lacks... crunch. Like a boiled vegetable."

"I'll try to add more crunch next time," Kaelen said dryly, grateful for the distraction.

"So, Kaelen," Lyra shifted, turning her body towards him. Her knee brushed his thigh. The contact was electric. "Why were the shiny boys so eager to turn you into a pincushion? That guard had shadow magic. That's not standard issue for the City Watch. That's expensive. That's 'black ops' expensive."

Kaelen looked at her. She was sharp. Sharper than she let on with her carefree attitude.

"I have something they want," Kaelen said carefully.

"Gold?" Drakon asked, perking up.

"No."

"Food?"

"No."

Drakon lost interest and went back to sulking.

"Information," Kaelen said. "Dangerous information. The kind that gets people killed. The kind that got my employer killed two nights ago."

Lyra’s smile faded slightly. "The Vane Letter," she guessed. "Rumor on the street is that Lord Valerius didn't just die of a 'bandit attack'. People say he was targeted."

Kaelen raised an eyebrow. "You know a lot for a tavern brawler."

"I'm an information broker," Lyra winked. "Among other things. Sniper, thief, heartbreaker. But mostly, I listen. And the streets are whispering, Kaelen. They're saying war is coming."

"It's already here," Kaelen said softly. "People just don't know it yet."

He looked at the two of them. A dragon prince and an elven rogue. They were chaotic, loud, and dangerous. But they had fought for him. Or at least, near him.

"The letter proves it," Kaelen admitted, lowering his voice. "The border skirmishes... they're fake. False flags. Orchestrated by a third party to drag us into a war with Aridia. And if we go to war, we'll be weak. And when we're weak..."

"The Shadows rise," Drakon finished, his voice surprisingly somber. He looked up, his reptilian eyes narrowing. "My people speak of this too. The Great Slumber is disturbed. The earth trembles not from shifting plates, but from fear."

Kaelen blinked. "You know about the Shadows?"

"Drakon knows many things," the dragon-man huffed. "Just because I enjoy roasted meats does not mean I am ignorant. The Ruby Peaks have felt the corruption. Wyverns going mad. Hatchlings born with black eyes. It is... unsettling."

"So we're all in the same boat," Lyra mused. "A boat that's sinking, on fire, and full of holes."

"And locked in a cell," Kaelen added.

"About that," Lyra grinned. She shifted again, and this time, she practically straddled the bench, facing him. Her face was very close now. "I might be able to help with the 'locked' part. But it requires concentration. And maybe a distraction."

She leaned in, her lips parting slightly. "Are you good at distractions, Kaelen?"

Kaelen swallowed. The air in the cell felt suddenly hot. "I... what kind of distraction?"

Lyra’s eyes danced. She reached up and tucked a strand of hair behind his ear, her fingers lingering on his jawline. "Oh, use your imagination."

She pulled a small, thin piece of wire from her braided hair. "But seriously, keep an eye on the guard."

She moved to the cell door.

"Hey!" A voice shouted from down the hall. A guard—a real one this time, looking tired and annoyed—marched up to the bars. He held a ring of keys.

"Step away from the door, elf," the guard sighed. "You're being released."

Lyra hid the wire instantly. "Released? My charm finally won you over?"

"Hardly," the guard grunted. He unlocked the door with a clang. "You can thank the lizard. Or rather, his diplomatic status."

Drakon stood up, puffing out his chest. "Ha! I knew my father's influence reached even this stone hovel!"

"The Drakorian Ambassador lodged a formal complaint," the guard explained, looking at Drakon with a mix of fear and disdain. "Apparently, arresting a Prince constitutes an 'Act of War'. So, the Captain wants you gone. All of you. Since you're... 'entourage'."

"Entourage?" Kaelen repeated, offended.

"Just go," the guard waved them out. "Before I change my mind and throw you in the hole. And take your weapons. They're at the desk."

## Part 2: The City of Whispers

The sun was blinding when they stepped out of the City Watch headquarters. It was midday, and the streets of Arcanis were bustling with life. Merchants hawked their wares, carriages clattered over cobblestones, and the smell of fresh bread wafted from a nearby bakery, mixing with the scent of unwashed bodies and horse manure.

It felt surreal. Inside, Kaelen carried the weight of a looming apocalypse. Outside, people were arguing about the price of turnips.

They retrieved their gear. Kaelen strapped his swords back on, feeling a wave of relief as the familiar weight settled on his hips. He ran his thumb over the hilt of the blue-wrapped shortsword. It hummed slightly at his touch.

Lyra checked her crossbow, running a finger lovingly along the stock. She checked the tension of the string, the click of the trigger mechanism. It was a beautiful weapon, crafted from darkwood and silver.

Drakon simply put his helmet back on, looking ready to headbutt a building.

"Well," Lyra said, stretching her arms above her head. The movement caused her leather top to ride up slightly, revealing a strip of pale, toned stomach. Kaelen politely looked away, which only made Lyra chuckle. "That was fun. A bit dusty, but fun. So, Kaelen... what now?"

Kaelen adjusted his cloak. "Now? I go to the Royal Palace. I find someone who isn't corrupt. I deliver the letter. And then I get paid."

"You think you can just walk into the Palace?" Lyra laughed. "Dressed like that? You look like you lost a fight with a thorn bush. The guards will shoot you before you get within ten feet of the gate."

"I have the letter," Kaelen said stubbornly. "The seal of House Vane..."

"...is from a minor house that nobody cares about," Lyra interrupted. "And if the Shadows are as deep as you say, the Palace is the most dangerous place you can be. Half the court is probably on their payroll."

Kaelen frowned. She was right. He knew she was right. But he didn't have a plan B. He was a sword, not a politician. He was used to cutting knots, not untying them.

"So what do you suggest?" he asked.

"You need an in," Lyra said. "Someone on the inside who isn't compromised. Someone high up."

"I have an uncle," Drakon offered. "He likes gold. He might know someone."

"Your uncle is a dragon," Lyra deadpanned. "He lives in a volcano. Not exactly 'palace adjacent'."

"He visits!" Drakon defended.

"Look," Lyra turned to Kaelen, her expression turning serious. She stepped closer, her voice dropping. "You can't do this alone. You saw those agents. They're elite. Level 8 at least. If you go alone, you die. And the letter disappears. And the war starts."

Kaelen looked at her. "Why do you care? You're a thief. A mercenary."

"I live here," Lyra shrugged. "I like my life. I like wine. I like not being dead. War is bad for business. Unless you're an arms dealer, which I am not. Plus..." She hesitated, a flicker of something softer in her eyes. "I saw what happened to Oakhaven. My... my sister lived near there."

Kaelen softened. "I'm sorry."

"Don't be," Lyra shook her head, the mask of indifference sliding back into place. "Just... let us help. You need muscle," she pointed at Drakon. "And you need brains," she pointed to herself. "And you... well, you have the plot coupon."

"Plot coupon?"

"The letter. Keep up, hero."

Kaelen looked at Drakon. The massive warrior nodded solemnly. "I too wish to prevent this darkness. And also, I wish to find a tavern that serves a proper portion size. Perhaps if we save the world, the King will grant me a whole cow."

Kaelen sighed. A long, suffering sigh. But underneath the annoyance, there was a glimmer of gratitude. He wasn't alone.

"Fine," he said. "We stick together. Until the letter is delivered."

*System Alert: Party Formed.*
*New Party Members: Lyra (Level 5 Rogue), Drakon (Level 6 Dragon Knight).*
*Current Objective: Infiltrate the Inner Circle.*

"Good choice," Lyra grinned, slapping him on the back. "First order of business: we need to get off the streets. But first, we need supplies. Drakon looks like he's about to eat a horse, and I'm out of bolts."

"I could eat a horse," Drakon agreed thoughtfully. "Or a cow. Or perhaps several sheep."

They made their way to the market district. The streets here were wider, lined with colorful stalls selling everything from exotic spices to enchanted trinkets. Kaelen kept his hood up, his eyes scanning the crowd.

*System Scan: Threat Analysis.*
*Target 1: Merchant (Level 2) - Non-Hostile.*
*Target 2: Beggar (Level 1) - Non-Hostile.*
*Target 3: City Guard (Level 4) - Caution Advised.*

The city was tense. Kaelen could feel it. People were whispering in corners.

"Did you hear?" a woman whispered to her neighbor as they passed a fruit stall. "They say the King is ill. They say he hasn't been seen in weeks."

"It's the Aridians," the neighbor replied. "They're poisoning him. I heard they have spies in the kitchen."

Kaelen frowned. The rumors were spreading fast.

They stopped at a weapon smith's stall. A burly dwarf was hammering a piece of steel.

"Bolts," Lyra said, leaning on the counter. "Armor piercing. And don't try to sell me the cheap iron ones. I want steel tips."

The dwarf looked her up and down. "Expensive taste for a street rat."

Lyra smiled, a dangerous smile. "I'm not a rat, darling. I'm a cat. And cats scratch."

While Lyra haggled, Drakon wandered over to a food stall. The vendor, a nervous-looking man, stared up at the seven-foot dragon-man.

"How much for the pig?" Drakon pointed to a whole roasted pig on a spit.

"Uh... five silver?" the man squeaked.

Drakon slapped a gold coin on the counter. "Keep the change. And the apple."

He grabbed the pig by the spit and took a massive bite, crunching through bone and meat alike. "Adequate," he declared.

Kaelen watched them, a small smile touching his lips. They were ridiculous. But they were effective.

"We should go," Kaelen said as Lyra returned with a quiver of new bolts. "We're drawing too much attention."

"You mean *he* is drawing attention," Lyra pointed at Drakon, who was now being followed by a group of awestruck street urchins.

"We need to get to the safe house," Kaelen said. "It's in the lower district. Less crowded."

They turned down a side street, leaving the bustle of the market behind. The noise faded, replaced by the sound of dripping water and distant dogs barking.

As they walked, Kaelen noticed something. The graffiti on the walls. It wasn't the usual gang signs. It was a symbol he had seen before. A black sun.

"The Cult of the Void," Kaelen murmured. "They're active here."

"Great," Lyra muttered. "Cultists. Why is it always cultists? Why can't we ever fight... I don't know, angry bakers?"

"Because angry bakers don't summon demons," Kaelen said grimly.

***

## Part 3: Shadows in the Sunlight

The alleyway was narrow, lined with laundry lines and discarded crates. It was a shortcut to the district where Kaelen maintained a small safehouse—a remnant of his more questionable mercenary days.

As they reached the midpoint of the alley, Kaelen stopped.

"Wait."

"What?" Drakon asked, almost bumping into him, a piece of pork still stuck to his cheek.

"It's too quiet," Kaelen said.

The alley was empty. No stray cats. No beggars. Just silence. Even the wind seemed to have died down. The shadows stretched long and thin, like grasping fingers.

"Ambush," Lyra whispered, her hand going to her crossbow.

From the rooftops above, four figures dropped. They didn't make a sound when they landed. They wore the same black leather and masks as the ones in the forest.

*System Alert: Threat Detected.*
*Enemy Analysis: Shadow Assassins (Level 8).*
*Combat Mode Engaged.*

"They found us fast," Kaelen growled, drawing his twin blades. The steel sang as it left the scabbards.

"Give us the letter," the leader of the assassins said. His voice was muffled, metallic. "And you may live."

"I doubt that," Kaelen said.

"Correct," the assassin replied.

He signaled.

Two assassins rushed Kaelen. One went for Lyra. The last one—a massive brute wielding a warhammer—charged Drakon.

"Finally!" Drakon roared, happiness in his voice. "Something to hit!"

Drakon met the warhammer charge with his bare hands. He caught the handle of the hammer mid-swing, the impact shaking the ground. The assassin's eyes went wide behind his mask.

"My turn," Drakon grinned. He headbutted the assassin. There was a sound like a melon being dropped from a tower. The assassin crumpled.

Lyra was already moving. She backflipped away from her attacker's dagger slash, firing a bolt mid-air. It took the assassin in the knee. As he stumbled, she drew two long daggers and closed the distance. "Too slow, darling!"

Kaelen was busy. His two opponents were perfectly synchronized. They attacked in a flurry of strikes, forcing him onto the defensive.

*Clang. Clang. Whoosh.*

He parried a thrust, ducked a high kick, and spun away from a slash that would have opened his throat.

*System Analysis: Attack Pattern Beta. Synchronization: 98%.*
*Recommendation: Disrupt Rhythm.*

Kaelen gritted his teeth. "You want the letter? Come and get it!"

He feinted left, drawing a strike from the first assassin, then pivoted right, bringing his shortsword up in a vicious arc. The blade caught the assassin's wrist, severing the tendons. The sword fell.

"Twin Fang: Cross Strike!"

Kaelen’s swords crossed, catching both assassins' blades in an 'X'. He twisted his wrists, locking their weapons, then kicked out with both feet, sending them stumbling back.

He didn't let up. He surged forward, his blue blade glowing faintly with mana.

He slashed across the chest of the first assassin, bypassing his guard. The man fell.

The second assassin hesitated. That hesitation cost him.

Kaelen lunged, his steel sword piercing the man's shoulder.

"Who sent you?" Kaelen demanded, twisting the blade. "Who is your contact in the palace?"

The assassin grunted in pain but didn't speak. Instead, his body began to convulse. Black smoke poured from his mouth and eyes.

"Suicide pill," Lyra shouted. "Get back!"

Kaelen jumped back just as the assassin's body dissolved into a puddle of black sludge. The other bodies did the same.

"Disgusting," Drakon noted, wiping slime off his armor. "And wasteful."

"They're cleaning up loose ends," Kaelen said, staring at the sludge. "They knew we were released. They have eyes inside the Watch."

"We can't go to the safe house," Lyra said, her face pale. "If they found us here, they know about your safe houses. They know everything."

Kaelen sheathed his swords. His hands were shaking slightly. Not from fear, but from anger.

"The letter isn't safe with me," he realized. "I'm the target."

"So give it to someone else," Drakon suggested.

Kaelen looked at Lyra.

"Oh no," she backed away. "Don't you look at me. I'm not carrying the 'Kill Me' scroll."

"You're a master thief," Kaelen said. "You can hide it better than I can. I'll draw their fire. You get it to the Palace."

"And how do I do that?" Lyra asked. "I'm a wanted criminal!"

"We'll figure it out," Kaelen said. "But right now, we need to move. That was just the advance team."

He handed the scroll case to Lyra. She took it reluctantly, looking at it like it was a venomous snake. Then she sighed, and tucked it into the bodice of her leather armor, right between her breasts.

"If I die because of this," she threatened, "I'm haunting you. And not in a sexy ghost way. In a 'moaning and rattling chains at 3 AM' way."

"Fair enough," Kaelen said.

"I will carry the snacks," Drakon volunteered.

They ran out of the alley, merging back into the crowd, three specks of light in a city rapidly falling into shadow.

## Part 4: The Safe House That Wasn't

The backup plan was a dusty attic above a bakery in the merchant district. It belonged to an old contact of Kaelen's, a retired adventurer named Hingle.

They slipped in through the back window as the sun began to set, casting long orange rays across the dusty floorboards.

"Cozy," Lyra remarked, coughing as she waved away a cloud of dust. "If you like asthma."

"It's safe," Kaelen said, barricading the door. "Hingle is loyal."

"Hingle is dead," Drakon said from the corner.

Kaelen spun around. Drakon was kneeling by a chair. In it sat an old man, his eyes glassy, a dagger in his chest.

"Dammit," Kaelen hissed. He rushed over, checking for a pulse. None. The body was cold. "They got here first."

"They really are thorough," Lyra whispered. She looked spooked. "Kaelen, who are these people? This isn't just a conspiracy. This is a purge."

"I told you," Kaelen said, closing the old man's eyes. "The Shadows."

He stood up, his face hardening. "We need to leave. Now."

But as he turned, he saw it. A Tripwire across the window they had just entered. A thin, silver thread catching the dying light.

"Down!"

He tackled Lyra just as the window exploded.

*BOOM.*

Fireball.

The blast blew the wall in. Kaelen shielded Lyra with his body, feeling the heat sear his back. Drakon roared, using his massive shield (which he had apparently produced from nowhere) to block the debris.

They were thrown across the room. Kaelen hit the floor hard, Lyra pinned beneath him.

For a moment, they were frozen. Kaelen looked down. Lyra’s eyes were wide, her breathing shallow. Her face was flushed, her lips parted. The adrenaline was high, and the intimacy of the position was undeniable. Her chest heaved against his, the scroll case pressing between them.

"You okay?" Kaelen rasped, his voice raw from the smoke.

"Ask me later," Lyra breathed. "Get off me, you heavy oaf."

But she didn't push him away immediately. Her hand lingered on his chest, her fingers curling into his tunic.

Then the roof caved in.

Drakon caught a falling beam with one hand. "We must go! The building is unstable!"

They scrambled out of the burning attic, jumping to the neighboring roof.

Below them, the street was filling with soldiers.

"There!" A captain shouted, pointing up at them. "The traitors! Kill them!"

"Traitors?" Lyra yelled. "We haven't even done anything yet!"

"Run," Kaelen said.

And so, the chase began.

## Part 5: The Weight of Command

As they ran across the roofs, Kaelen's mind raced. He had failed Hingle. He had failed to protect Valerius. He was failing to protect his new team.

*System Alert: Stress Levels High. Mental Stability: Unstable.*

He pushed the thought aside. He couldn't afford to doubt himself. Not now.

"Left!" he shouted, directing them towards the cathedral. "We can lose them in the bell tower!"

They leaped across a wide gap. Lyra landed gracefully. Drakon landed heavily, cracking the roof tiles beneath his weight. Kaelen landed last, his boots skidding on loose tiles.

He looked back. The soldiers were climbing the walls. And behind them, moving with supernatural speed, were more shadows.

"They're gaining!" Lyra called out, her voice tight with strain.

Kaelen scanned the environment. The rooftops of Arcanis were a maze of chimney stacks, slanted slate, and narrow washing lines. It was a playground for thieves and assassins, but a death trap for the unwary.

*System Analysis: Escape Route Calculation.*
*Option A: Northern Gate. Probability of Success: 12%.*
*Option B: Sewers. Probability of Success: 45%.*
*Option C: High Temple District. Probability of Success: 38%.*

"The Temple District," Kaelen decided aloud. "Higher ground. More cover."

"And more guards," Lyra countered, firing a bolt blindly behind her. A cry of pain answered her.

"Drakon!" Kaelen shouted. "We need a bridge! Can you knock that chimney stack?"

Drakon looked at the massive brick chimney ahead of them, bridging the gap to the next building. "I can do better than knock it! I can throw it!"

The dragon-man charged, his shoulder slamming into the base of the chimney. With a roar that shook the very foundations of the building, the bricks gave way. The chimney toppled, crashing across the alleyway to form a crude, dusty bridge.

"Go!"

They scrambled across the makeshift bridge just as arrows began to pepper the roof they had just left. Kaelen risked a glance downward. The street was swarming with City Watch, but amongst the silver and blue uniforms, he saw figures in black cloaks directing them.

"The corruption goes deep," he muttered. "The Watch is taking orders from the Shadows."

"Focus on running, analyze later!" Lyra grabbed his cloak, pulling him forward.

They reached the other side, but their path was blocked. A figure stood on the peak of the roof, silhouetted against the rising moon. He wore the uniform of a Captain of the Watch, but his eyes glowed with a faint, unnatural violet light.

"Captain Thorne," Kaelen recognized him. A man known for his honor. Or he used to be.

"Surrender, Kaelen," Thorne said, his voice layered with a strange, harmonic distortion. "The Master has need of the letter. And your friends."

"Thorne, listen to me," Kaelen pleaded, drawing his swords. "You're being controlled. Fight it!"

"There is nothing to fight," Thorne smiled, a cruel, twist of lips. "There is only the Void."

He drew a greatsword that pulsed with dark energy.

*System Alert: Elite Enemy Detected.*
*Name: Captain Thorne (Corrupted).*
*Level: 12.*
*Weakness: Unknown.*

"Drakon, Lyra, keep moving!" Kaelen ordered. "I'll hold him off!"

"No!" Lyra shouted. "We don't leave people behind! That's rule number one!"

"Since when do we have rules?" Kaelen snapped, parrying a massive overhead swing from Thorne. The impact jarred his bones.

"Since about five minutes ago!" Lyra retorted. She circled around, looking for an opening.

Thorne was fast. Impossibly fast for a man in full plate armor. He swung the greatsword like a twig, driving Kaelen back towards the edge of the roof.

"The Void hungers," Thorne chanted. "It demands sustenance."

"Feed it this!" Drakon yelled. He picked up a loose gargoyle statue—a heavy stone grotesque—and hurled it.

Thorne didn't even look. He simply raised a hand, and a barrier of violet energy appeared. The gargoyle shattered against it.

"Magic," Drakon spat. "I hate magic."

Kaelen saw an opening. Thorne was focused on Drakon.

"System Skill: Flash Step."

Kaelen vanished, reappearing instantly behind Thorne. He thrust his blue blade towards the Captain's unarmored neck.

*Clang.*

Thorne had blocked it behind his back, without looking. He spun, his elbow catching Kaelen in the chest.

Kaelen flew backwards, sliding across the tiles. He gasped, the wind knocked out of him. Health bar flashed red. *72%.*

"Pathetic," Thorne sneered, advancing. "Is this the best the 'Hero of the Border' can do?"

Lyra fired three bolts in rapid succession. *Ping. Ping. Ping.* They bounced off Thorne's magical aura.

"We can't win this," Kaelen realized. "Not here. Not now."

He looked at the edge of the roof. Below them was the canal that ran through the Temple District. It was a long drop.

"Jump," Kaelen whispered.

"What?" Lyra asked, horrified.

"Into the canal!" Kaelen shouted. "Drakon, grab Lyra!"

"With pleasure!" Drakon scooped up the protesting elf.

"Wait! I can't swim!" Lyra screamed.

"I float!" Drakon assured her.

"Kaelen!" Thorne lunged, his sword wreathed in violet fire.

Kaelen grinned. He sheathed his swords and saluted.

"Catch you later, Captain."

He backflipped off the edge.

Thorne's blade sliced through the empty air where Kaelen had been a fraction of a second before.

The wind rushed past Kaelen. He saw the dark water rushing up. He saw Drakon and Lyra splashing down a few seconds ahead of him.

*Splash.*

The cold water hit him like a hammer. He went under, the darkness swallowing him.

*System Alert: Environment Change detected. Hydro-dynamics engaged.*

He kicked to the surface, gasping for air. Drakon was paddling like a giant dog, Lyra clinging to his back, coughing and cursing in Elvish.

"That," Lyra sputtered, "was the worst plan ever."

"We're alive," Kaelen pointed out, swimming towards them. "And we lost him."

He looked back up at the roof. Captain Thorne stood there, watching them. He didn't follow. He just watched, his violet eyes glowing in the dark.

"For now," Kaelen added quietly.

The current took them, carrying them deeper into the city, towards the looming shadows of the unknown. The night was just beginning. And it was going to be a long one.
