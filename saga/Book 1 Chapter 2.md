# Chapter 2: Chains of Fate

## Prologue: The Spider's Web

High above the slums of Arcanis, in a spire that didn't appear on any official city map, Xylos the Shadow Weaver sat cross-legged on a floating cushion of solidified darkness. The room was circular, the walls lined with mirrors that showed not reflections, but distant places: a council chamber in Aetheria, a barracks in Drakoria, a brothel in Eldoria.

Xylos watched them all with his many eyes—magical sensors drifting around his hooded head like fireflies.

The door to his sanctum dissolved into mist, and a figure stumbled in. It was the assassin from the rooftop, the one who had fled Kaelen’s blade. He was clutching his shoulder, his breath ragged.

"Master," the assassin wheezed, dropping to one knee. "We... we failed."

Xylos didn't turn. He waved a withered hand, and the mirrors went dark. "Failure," he rasped, his voice sounding like dry parchment crumbling. "Such a pedestrian word. Did you lose the target?"

"We found him," the assassin said quickly. "The mercenary. He has the Vane Letter. But... he was not alone. He has allies. A Drakorian Prince and an Elven exile."

Xylos turned then. His face was a void of shadow, save for two pinpricks of violet light. "A Drakorian? In Arcanis? That complicates the calculus."

"They are formidable," the assassin continued. "The mercenary... he moves like a veteran. He anticipates our strikes. And the dragon... he breathes fire. We were unprepared."

"Unprepared," Xylos mused. He drifted closer, the shadows in the room stretching towards him like eager pets. "You had the element of surprise. You had elite training. You had Void weapons. And yet, you were defeated by a drunk lizard and a human with a rusty sword."

"Please, Master!" the assassin begged, sensing the shift in the air. "Give me another chance! I know where they are going! The City Watch has them!"

"The City Watch," Xylos sighed. "Bureaucracy. The one force even I struggle to manipulate fully. Captain Valerus is... stubborn. Honorable. A dying breed."

Xylos extended a finger. A tendril of shadow shot out, wrapping around the assassin's throat. The man clawed at it, gasping, but his hands passed right through the smoky substance.

"Your failure risks exposure," Xylos whispered. "The Letter must not reach the King. If Valerus reads it, he becomes a liability. If he doesn't... he is still an obstacle."

The assassin's struggles ceased. He slumped to the floor, his eyes glassy.

Xylos retracted the shadow. "No matter. The seeds are already sown. If the mercenary wants to play hero, let him. Heroes make such excellent martyrs."

He turned back to the mirrors. One showed the interior of a holding cell in the City Dungeon. He watched the three figures inside.

"Enjoy your rest," Xylos murmured. "Tomorrow, the real game begins."

## Part 1: The Rooftop Run

The night air of Arcanis bit at Kaelen’s exposed skin as he burst out of the alleyway, his boots skidding on the cobblestones. Behind him, the sounds of chaos from 'The Severed Cock' were fading, replaced by the rhythmic clatter of armored boots and the shrill whistle of City Watch patrols.

"This way!" Lyra shouted, vaulting onto a stack of crates with feline grace. She didn't stop at the top; she sprang upwards, her fingers finding purchase on a wooden beam protruding from a second-story balcony. With a grunt of effort, she hauled herself up, her long legs kicking in the air for a moment before she rolled onto the roof.

"Show off," Kaelen muttered, sheathing his swords. He followed her path, his movements less graceful but just as effective. He used his momentum to run up the wall, grabbing the beam and swinging himself over the railing.

*System Alert: Agility Check Passed.*
*Stamina: 78%*

Below them, Drakon was having a harder time. The massive Dragon Knight looked at the crates, then at the balcony, and shook his head. "This architecture is flimsy! It will not support my magnificence!"

"Just climb, you over-sized gecko!" Lyra hissed from the roof, nocking a bolt into her crossbow but keeping it aimed low. "The guards are turning the corner!"

Drakon roared—a sound that was probably meant to be a sigh—and leaped. He didn't use the crates. He simply jumped, his powerful leg muscles propelling him upwards like a siege weapon's payload. He caught the edge of the balcony, the stone groaning under his weight. Chunks of masonry crumbled, falling to the street below with a crash.

"Subtle," Kaelen deadpanned as he offered a hand to haul the dragon-man up.

"I am built for war, not for skulking," Drakon huffed, dusting off his leather-and-plate armor. "Where are we going, little sword-man?"

"Away from the guys with the pointy sticks," Kaelen said, scanning the rooftops. "If we get caught now, we'll rot in a cell before I can deliver this letter."

"Letter?" Lyra asked, her ears twitching. "Is that what this is about? A love letter? Did you sleep with a Duchess?"

"I wish," Kaelen muttered. "Move."

They ran across the rooftops of the slums, leaping across narrow gaps between the ramshackle buildings. The city of Arcanis sprawled out before them, a sea of lights. To the north, the noble district glowed with magical streetlamps and the golden aura of the Royal Palace. To the south, where they were, it was dark, dirty, and dangerous.

*System Alert: Enemy Detection. Multiple Targets.*

Kaelen stopped, holding up a fist. "Down."

The three of them crouched behind a chimney stack. Below, in the street, a patrol of City Watch was marching. But these weren't the corrupted Shadow agents from the tavern. These were regular guards, looking tired and annoyed.

"We can take them," Drakon whispered, his hand drifting to the massive mace at his belt. "I count only ten."

"We're not killing innocent guards, Drakon," Kaelen hissed. "We're trying to save the kingdom, remember? Or at least, I am."

"Boring," Drakon grumbled.

"Wait," Lyra said, pointing to the east. "Look."

On a rooftop parallel to them, shadows were moving. Not shadows cast by the moon, but shadows that had mass. They moved against the wind, fluid and silent.

"Shadow Agents," Kaelen realized, his grip tightening on his hilt. "They're tracking us."

Suddenly, a bolt of dark energy sizzled through the air, striking the chimney right next to Kaelen’s head. Stone exploded, sending shards cutting into his cheek.

"Ambush!" Lyra yelled, spinning and firing her crossbow blindly into the dark.

Figures erupted from the gloom—four of them, dressed in the same tight black leather as the ones in the forest. They moved with unnatural speed, leaping across the gap between the buildings. But these weren't just grunts. One of them, taller than the rest, wielded a chain-whip that glowed with necrotic purple light.

*System Alert: Elite Enemy Detected. Shadow Captain.*

Kaelen drew his blades. "Drakon, keep them off Lyra! Lyra, try not to shoot me!"

"No promises!"

Combat erupted on the sloped roof. It was a chaotic mess. The tiles were slick with moss, and footing was treacherous.

Kaelen engaged the Shadow Captain. The enemy swung the chain-whip, the links rattling like bones. Kaelen ducked, feeling the wind of the weapon pass inches from his ear.

*System Alert: Dodge Successful.*

He lunged, his longsword aiming for the Captain's chest. The Captain flicked his wrist, and the chain wrapped around Kaelen’s blade, jerking him forward.

"Too slow, human," the Captain hissed, his voice distorted by his mask.

Kaelen didn't panic. He let the momentum carry him, dropping to one knee and sweeping his short sword at the Captain's legs. The Captain jumped, unwinding the chain.

"Drakon! Need a light!" Kaelen shouted.

"With pleasure!"

Drakon, who was currently holding two assassins by their heads and bashing them together like cymbals, turned. He opened his maw and unleashed a torrent of fire.

It wasn't a precision strike. It was a wall of flame that engulfed the rooftop. The assassins scattered, screeching as the fire caught their cloaks.

The Shadow Captain cursed, retreating from the heat. "This isn't over!" he yelled, disappearing into the smoke.

"They're retreating," Kaelen said, retrieving his sword. "Why?"

"Because of them," Lyra said, pointing down.

The alleyways below were suddenly flooded with light. Not magical light, but torches. Hundreds of them.

"In the name of the King!" a voice boomed, amplified by magic. "Surrender! You are surrounded!"

Kaelen looked over the edge. The entire block was cordoned off by the City Watch. Archers were positioned on the surrounding roofs, arrows nocked and aimed at them. At the front of the formation on the ground stood a man in gleaming gold armor—Captain Valerus (no relation to the dead noble, hopefully).

"Well," Kaelen sighed, sheathing his swords. "We can't fight the whole army."

Drakon looked ready to try. "I can take the left flank."

"No," Kaelen said firmly. "We surrender. If they are regular guards, we have a chance to talk. If we fight, we're branded traitors and cut down."

Lyra unstrung her crossbow, looking disappointed. "I hate cells. They smell like wet dog. No offense, Drakon."

"None taken," Drakon said, confused. "I am a dragon, not a canine."

Kaelen raised his hands. "We're coming down! Don't shoot!"

***

## Part 2: The Dungeon of Lament

The holding cell in the Arcanis City Dungeon was exactly as Lyra had predicted: damp, dark, and smelling of things that were best left unidentified.

Kaelen sat on the cold stone floor, his back against the wall, knees drawn up. They had been stripped of their weapons and gear, leaving him feeling naked and vulnerable. He traced the scars on his arms, his mind racing. The letter was gone—confiscated by the Captain along with his swords. If the wrong person read it...

"I am hungry," Drakon announced for the fifth time in ten minutes. The massive dragon-man was pacing the small cell, his head nearly scraping the ceiling. "Do they not feed prisoners in this kingdom? In Drakoria, even the condemned get a final meal of roasted goat."

"Drakon," Lyra said from her perch on the single, rot-infested wooden bench. "If you say you're hungry one more time, I'm going to feed you your own boots."

"Leather has no nutritional value," Drakon retorted seriously. "I require protein. Meat. Perhaps a cow. Or a very large pig."

Lyra rolled her eyes, looking at Kaelen. "Is he always like this?"

"I met him twenty minutes before you did," Kaelen muttered. "We're not exactly old war buddies."

"He has a point though," Drakon said, stopping to look at the bars. "This hospitality is lacking. In my homeland, hospitality is sacred. If a guest is hungry, the host is shamed. These humans have no shame."

"Tell us about Drakoria," Kaelen said, mostly to distract him. "Is it really full of volcanoes?"

"It is beautiful," Drakon said, a wistful look in his reptilian eyes. "The mountains breathe fire. The rivers run with liquid gold—well, molten rock, but it looks like gold. We build our keeps in the calderas. The heat... it warms the blood. Here, the air is thin and cold. It makes my scales itch."

"And you?" Kaelen asked Lyra. "Why are you here? Sylvanaria is supposed to be paradise. Why leave paradise for... this?" He gestured to the dripping walls.

Lyra’s playfulness vanished for a moment. She looked at her hands. "Paradise has rules, Kaelen. Too many rules. Sylvanaria isn't what people think. The Matriarchs... they believe that if we ignore the world, the world will ignore us. They see humans as children playing with fire."

"Are they wrong?" Kaelen asked.

"No," Lyra admitted. "But when the house is burning down, you don't scold the child. You put out the fire."

She sighed, leaning her head back. "I was a sniper in the Border Guard. I saw a village being attacked by goblins. Just across the river. Human village. My commander ordered me to stand down. 'Not our problem,' he said. 'Let the short-lives die.'"

Kaelen watched her. "What did you do?"

"I shot the goblin chief through the eye from three hundred yards," Lyra said, a grim smile returning. "And then I shot his lieutenants. I saved the village. And for my 'insubordination' and 'reckless exposure of Elven secrets', I was stripped of my rank and kicked out. Told never to return."

"You did the right thing," Kaelen said softy.

"Doesn't feel like it sometimes," Lyra admitted. Then she shook her head, the mask of the jester sliding back into place. She hopped off the bench and sauntered over to Kaelen. She leaned down, her face inches from his.

"So, 'Kaelen'," she purred, the name rolling off her tongue with a teasing lilt. "Now that we've shared our tragic backstories, it's your turn. Who hurt you, handsome? You've got that 'broody hero' vibe down to a science."

Kaelen looked up at her. Her emerald eyes were bright in the gloom, filled with a mix of amusement and genuine curiosity. "I didn't ask for your help."

"True," she admitted, sitting down next to him, close enough that their shoulders touched. "But you looked like you needed it. And I was bored. Plus, that guard had a very punchable face."

"He was a Shadow Agent," Kaelen said quietly.

Lyra’s smile faded slightly. "I know. I saw the purple glow on his blade. Void magic. Nasty stuff. You don't see that every day, especially not in the City Watch."

"You know about Void magic?" Kaelen asked, surprised.

"I'm an Elf, darling," she said. "We remember the old stories. Void magic is... forbidden. It eats the soul. Anyone using it isn't human anymore."

Kaelen closed his eyes, leaning his head back against the wall. *System Analysis: Lyra. Race: Elf. Class: Sniper. Disposition: Chaotic Good. Trust Level: Low but Rising.*

"The letter," Kaelen whispered. "The one they took. It proves that the Shadow Agents have infiltrated the military. They're trying to start a war between the kingdoms to feed... something."

"Feed the Demon King," Drakon rumbled.

Kaelen’s eyes snapped open. "You know?"

"Drakoria remembers," Drakon said. "The Great War. My grandfather fought in it. He told me stories of the Dark One. The one who eats sorrow. The skies turned black, and the fire in our bellies went cold. They say he was defeated, but a thing like that... it does not die. It only sleeps."

"If he returns," Lyra said softly, a shiver running through her, "then this little cell won't matter. None of this will matter."

"Exactly," Kaelen said. "That's why I need to get out of here."

***

## Part 3: The Nightmare

Eventually, exhaustion took them. Drakon curled up in the corner, snoring like a lumber mill. Lyra dozed on the bench.

Kaelen tried to stay awake, but the adrenaline crash was brutal. His eyelids grew heavy, and soon, the darkness of the cell was replaced by a darker, colder place.

*Dream Sequence Initiated.*

*He was back in the village. Not Oakhaven. His home. Riverwood.*

*The air smelled of smoke and copper. Blood. So much blood. The sky was a bruised purple, unnatural and heavy.*

*He was younger, barely seventeen. He held a sword—a rusted thing, chipped and useless. He was standing over... her. Elara. Her golden hair was matted with mud and red.*

*"Run, Kaelen," she whispered. Her voice was wet. A red flower bloomed on her white dress.*

*"I can't," he sobbed, his hands pressing against the wound, trying to keep the life inside her. "I can't leave you. I promised."*

*"Promises break," a voice boomed.*

*The Shadow stood over them. Not a generic agent, but a General. Malakor. The armor of fused bone. The burning red eyes. He was immense, blotting out the sun. His aura was suffocating, a weight that crushed the lungs.*

*Malakor laughed, a sound like grinding glaciers. "Weakness," he sneered. "Your love makes you weak. Your hope makes you fragile. Look at her. Look at what your hesitation cost her."*

*Malakor raised his blade, a massive slab of obsidian that seemed to drink the light.*

*Kaelen tried to move, to block, but his limbs were lead. The System Alerts were screaming in his vision—red boxes overlapping until he was blind.*

*Error. Fear Status Effect: Paralyzed.*
*Error. Level Too Low.*
*Error. Cannot Save Target.*

*"Watch," Malakor commanded.*

*The blade fell. Slow. Inevitable.*

*"NO!"*

Kaelen woke with a gasp, his hand scrabbling for a sword that wasn't there. He was drenched in cold sweat, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird.

"Bad dream?"

Lyra was watching him. She hadn't moved from the bench, but her gaze was sharp, dissecting him.

Kaelen rubbed his face, trying to scrub the image of the dead girl from his mind. "Something like that."

"You were shouting," she said softly. "A name. 'Elara'?"

Kaelen stiffened. "It doesn't matter."

"It matters to you," Lyra said. She didn't mock him this time. She stood up and walked over, sitting beside him on the cold floor. She didn't touch him, but her presence was a grounding weight. "We all have ghosts, Kaelen. I see the goblin chief every time I close my eyes. Drakon probably sees... well, whatever dragons are afraid of. Eels, maybe?"

Kaelen managed a weak chuckle. "He seems afraid of starvation."

"The point is," Lyra said, "you're not alone in the dark. Not anymore."

Kaelen looked at her. In the dim light, she looked less like a teasing rogue and more like a weary soldier. He realized then that she was just as lost as he was.

***

## Part 4: Diplomatic Immunity

The heavy iron door of the cell block clanged open, echoing like a funeral bell. Heavy footsteps approached their cell.

"Get up, scum," a guard barked, banging his spear against the bars.

Drakon groaned, unfolding his massive frame. "Is it lunchtime?"

"It's interrogation time," the guard sneered. He unlocked the cell door. "Move. The Captain wants a word."

They were marched down a stone corridor, shackles clanking, into a large interrogation room. It was stark, lit by a single magical orb suspended from the ceiling. Captain Valerus sat behind a heavy oak desk. Beside him stood another man—thin, weasel-faced, wearing the robes of a City Magistrate.

On the desk lay Kaelen’s swords... and the scroll case.

Valerus was a stern man with graying hair and a scar running down his jaw. He looked tired.

"Sit," Valerus commanded.

"Captain," the Magistrate hissed, "why are we indulging these criminals? The human is a spy. The elf is a vagrant. And the... beast... is a menace. We should execute them and be done with it."

Drakon bristled. "Beast? I am a Prince!"

"Prince of the rocks and lizards," the Magistrate spat.

Valerus slammed his hand on the desk. "Silence, Magistrate Thorne. I run this station."

He looked at the trio. "Do you know," Valerus began, his voice calm but dangerous, "how much paperwork is involved when a Dragon Prince is arrested for a bar brawl?"

Drakon blinked. "You know who I am?"

"The scales give it away," Valerus said dryly. "And the diplomatic crest on your armor. Prince Drakon of Drakoria. Third in line for the Obsidian Throne."

"Second," Drakon corrected. "My brother ate a bad mushroom."

"Right," Valerus rubbed his temples. "Second. Do you have any idea the diplomatic nightmare you've caused? If I keep you here, your father might decide to burn this city to the ground to get you back."

"He might," Drakon agreed cheerfully. "He is very protective. And he has a temper."

The Magistrate turned pale. "Prince? But... the reports said..."

"The reports were incomplete," Valerus cut him off. He looked at Kaelen. "And you. The mercenary with the stolen documents."

Kaelen stepped forward, the chains rattling. "Those documents aren't stolen. Lord Valerius gave them to me before he was murdered."

"Murdered by bandits," the Magistrate interjected quickly. "A tragic accident."

"Murdered by Shadow Agents," Kaelen corrected, staring directly at the Magistrate. "Agents who are infiltrating your ranks. Agents who attacked us on the rooftops last night. You saw the bodies, didn't you, Captain? Or did they dissolve before you could inspect them?"

Valerus stared at Kaelen. For a moment, the mask of the weary bureaucrat slipped, revealing a man who was deeply afraid.

"The bodies dissolved into black sludge," Valerus said quietly. "Void matter."

"Captain!" the Magistrate shrieked. "You cannot listen to this madness! Void matter is a myth!"

"Then explain the scorch marks on the roof!" Valerus roared, standing up. "Explain why my best men are disappearing! Explain why *you* were so eager to have these three executed before I arrived!"

The room went silent. The Magistrate took a step back, sweat beading on his lip.

"I... I only seek justice," the Magistrate stammered.

Valerus sat back down, his eyes hard. He picked up the scroll case. He weighed it in his hand.

"If I release you," Valerus said to Kaelen, "you disappear. You were never here. I never saw this letter."

"You're giving it back?" Kaelen asked, stunned.

"I can't act on this," Valerus admitted, shame coloring his tone. "I have a family. If the Shadows are as deep as you say... anyone who reads this is a dead man walking. I can't be that hero. I'm just a Captain."

He tossed the scroll case to Kaelen.

"But," Valerus continued, looking at Drakon. "I can release the Prince into the custody of his 'retainers'. That is the loophole."

"Retainers?" Drakon asked.

"Yes," Valerus looked at Kaelen and Lyra. "You are now officially the retainers of Prince Drakon. You are under his diplomatic protection. Which means you are his responsibility. If you cause trouble, it falls on him."

"I accept!" Drakon beamed. "I have always wanted minions!"

"Retainers," Kaelen corrected through gritted teeth.

"Minions," Drakon insisted.

Valerus stood up. He glared at the Magistrate. "Get them out of here. And Thorne? If I find out you spoke to anyone about this... I'll feed you to the Prince myself."

***

## Part 5: The Safehouse

They stood outside the City Watch station, blinking in the midday sun. They had their gear back. Kaelen checked his swords; they were untouched.

"Well," Lyra stretched, her joints popping. "That went better than expected. I was expecting torture. Or at least a stern lecture. The Magistrate looked like he wanted to bite us, though."

"He was afraid," Kaelen said, tucking the scroll case deep into his armor. "He knows something. Valerus saved our lives in there."

"We are free!" Drakon declared. "Now, lunch! I saw a vendor selling meat on a stick. It smelled questionable, but delicious."

"Wait," Kaelen said. He looked at his companions. "You're free to go. Really. You don't have to stay with me. This... this is going to get dangerous. The Shadows know I have this. They won't stop hunting me."

Lyra looked at him, her expression unreadable. "You're trying to get rid of us?"

"I'm trying to keep you alive," Kaelen said. "This isn't your fight."

"It became our fight when they shot at me," Lyra said, checking the fletching on her bolts. "Elves hold grudges, Kaelen. Besides, where else am I going to go? And you're... interesting."

She winked, but there was steel in her voice.

"I cannot leave," Drakon shrugged. "You are my retainer now. A Prince does not abandon his subjects. It would be dishonorable. Also, you owe me lunch."

Kaelen looked at them. Really looked at them.

*System Alert: Party Formation Request. Accept? [Y/N]*

He sighed, a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. "Fine. But we do things my way. We need to get off the streets. We need a safe house."

"I know a place," Lyra said. "In the slums. It's a rat hole, but it's *my* rat hole."

"Lead the way," Kaelen said.

They moved through the winding streets of the lower city. The slums of Arcanis were a maze of narrow alleys, hanging laundry, and crumbling brickwork. Beggars watched them with hollow eyes, and street urchins darted through the crowds like fish in a stream.

Lyra led them to a dilapidated building that leaned precariously against the city wall. The windows were boarded up, and the door hung on one hinge.

"Home sweet home," she announced, kicking the door open.

Inside, it was surprisingly cozy. A few stolen rugs covered the dirt floor, and a hammock was strung up in the corner. There was a small hearth with cold ashes.

"It is... rustic," Drakon observed, ducking his head to enter. "Does it have a kitchen?"

"It has a fire pit," Lyra said. "Don't be picky."

Kaelen immediately went into soldier mode. He checked the perimeter. He tested the boards on the windows. He set up a tripwire near the door using a spool of thread from his pack.

"Paranoid much?" Lyra asked, watching him.

"Prepared," Kaelen corrected. "If Xylos—or whoever sent those assassins—knows we're alive, they'll be looking."

He sat down on a crate, the exhaustion finally catching up to him. He pulled out the letter. He looked at the seal.

"So, Boss," Lyra said, leaning against the wall. "What's the plan? We have the letter. We have the team. What now?"

"The letter mentions a contact," Kaelen lied smoothly. He didn't want to reveal everything yet. "But I need to decipher the rest of the code. For now, we rest. We heal. And we prepare."

"Prepare for what?" Drakon asked, poking the fire pit with a claw.

"War," Kaelen said darkly.

He leaned back, closing his eyes for a moment. But even in rest, his mind was working. The System—his curse, his gift—wouldn't let him be.

*System Access: Party Overview.*

Kaelen focused on Drakon first. The dragon was currently trying to chew on a piece of dried meat that looked harder than rock.

*Target: Drakon*
*Class: Dragon Knight (Hybrid)*
*Level: 6 (Estimated)*
*HP: 100%*
*Mana: 85%*
*Skills Observed: Flame Breath, Seismic Leap, Draconic Strength.*
*Weakness: Low Agility, Gluttony, Gullible.*

Kaelen mentally noted the weaknesses. Drakon was a tank. A siege engine. He could take hits that would vaporize Kaelen, but he was slow. In a fight against agile Shadow Agents, he would need support.

Then, Kaelen shifted his focus to Lyra. She was cleaning her crossbow, humming a soft tune that sounded oddly melancholy.

*Target: Lyra*
*Class: Sniper / Ranger*
*Level: 5 (Estimated)*
*HP: 90% (Minor bruising)*
*Stamina: 60%*
*Skills Observed: Precision Shot, Acrobatics, Stealth.*
*Weakness: Low Defense, Cynicism, Kleptomania.*

Lyra was the glass cannon. High damage, low survivability. If an enemy closed the distance, she was in trouble. That meant Kaelen’s role was clear. He was the bridge. The frontline DPS (Damage Per Second) who had to weave between Drakon's chaos and Lyra's precision.

*Synergy Rating: 15% (Poor)*
*Projected Survival Rate against Malakor: 0.00%*

Kaelen grimaced at the number. Zero percent. They weren't ready. Not even close. If Malakor found them now, they were dead. They needed to level up. They needed better gear. And most importantly, they needed trust.

"Hey," Kaelen said, breaking the silence. "If we're going to do this... we need to know how to fight together. Drakon, your fire breath. What's the cooldown?"

Drakon blinked. "Cool... down? I do not understand. My fire is hot!"

"How often can you use it?" Kaelen clarified.

"Ah! Until my throat gets dry," Drakon said. "Or until I run out of spicy food fuel."

"Right," Kaelen rubbed his temples. "We'll work on that. Lyra, your range. Effective distance?"

"I can hit a fly off a mule's ear at four hundred paces," she said without looking up. "Five hundred if the wind is right."

"Good," Kaelen nodded. "Then here's the formation. Drakon takes point. You draw their attention. Be loud. Be scary."

"I excel at this!" Drakon agreed.

"Lyra, you take high ground whenever possible. Cover our flanks. Prioritize enemy mages or archers."

"And you?" Lyra asked.

"I kill everything else," Kaelen said simply.

It wasn't much of a plan, but it was a start. The System flickered in his vision.

*Synergy Rating: 18% (Poor)*

Well, it was an improvement.

## Interlude: The Queen's Burden

Miles away, in the floating city of Celestia, Queen Elfiria of Aetheria stood on the balcony of the High Temple. The wind whipped her silver hair around her face, but she didn't feel the cold.

She felt something else. A tremor in the Aether.

"Your Majesty?"

She turned. It was High Priestess Aurelia, her chief advisor. "Is something wrong?"

Elfiria looked out at the horizon, where the sun was setting behind the jagged peaks of the Dragon's Spine.

"I don't know, Aurelia," Elfiria whispered. "I feel... a shadow. It's growing. Something has awakened in the dark."

"The seals are intact," Aurelia assured her. "The Holy Dome is ready. Our diviners have seen nothing but clear skies."

"Clear skies can hide the fiercest storms," Elfiria countered, her voice firm. She walked to the edge of the balcony, her white robes fluttering like wings. "The political situation is unraveling, Aurelia. Eldoria is paralyzed by paranoia. Drakoria isolates itself further every day. Even Sylvanaria has closed its borders. We are five fingers of a hand that refuses to make a fist."

"The Council believes that neutrality is our best defense," Aurelia said stiffly.

"Neutrality is a shield made of paper when the enemy wields fire," Elfiria said bitterly. "I had a dream last night. I saw a sword. Two swords, actually. One steel, one wrapped in blue cloth. And I saw fire—a dragon's fire, but tamed, directed. And I saw an arrow that pierced the dark."

"Dreams are just dreams, Majesty. Manifestations of your anxiety."

"Perhaps," Elfiria said. She touched the amulet at her throat—the key to the Holy Dome. It hummed against her skin, a warm, comforting vibration. But even that warmth couldn't chase away the chill in her bones. "But I fear the time for dreaming is over. If the Shadow returns... if He returns... Aetheria cannot stand alone. No kingdom can."

She looked south, towards Eldoria. Towards Arcanis. Somewhere out there, the pieces were moving. She just hoped they were moving in the right direction.

"Send a messenger to King Alaric," Elfiria commanded, her tone brooking no argument. "And send one to the Dragon Council. Tell them... tell them the Queen of Aetheria asks them to watch the shadows. And tell them to prepare for guests."

***

Back in the safehouse, Kaelen felt a prickle on the back of his neck. He glanced through the cracks in the boarded window.

Outside, on a nearby roof, a raven was perched. Its eyes were not black, but a glowing, malevolent red. It watched the safehouse for a moment, then took flight, soaring towards the Spire of Anguish in the distance.

The Shadows were watching. The game was still on.

But this time, Kaelen wasn't playing alone.
