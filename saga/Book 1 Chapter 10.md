# Chapter 10: The Battlefield of Valor

## Prologue: The View from the Throne

*Location: The Valley of Kings*
*Time: The Clash*

The Demon King, Azezel, sat on his throne of fused bone. The throne was not merely a chair; it was a conduit, channeling the dark leylines of the world directly into his veins.

He was bored.

"They march with such... enthusiasm," he mused, tapping a claw on the skull of a former king.

Beside him stood Malakor, healed but sulking. The General's armor had been repaired, but his pride was still cracked. "Let me crush them, my King. I owe the human a death."

"Patience, General," Azezel waved a hand, dismissing the thought like a fly. "Let them break themselves against the waves first. I want to see this 'Sword Saint' they worship."

He leaned forward, his eyes—voids of nothingness that absorbed the ambient light—focusing on the glowing figure at the front of the Alliance army.

"A fallen star," Azezel smiled. "How quaint. I wonder if it breaks?"

## Part 1: The Meat Grinder

*Location: The Front Lines*
*Time: Combat Start*

The collision of fifty thousand soldiers against a hundred thousand demons made a sound that Kaelen felt in his teeth. It wasn't a clang; it was a crunch. The sound of metal, bone, and wood shattering simultaneously.

"Hold the line!" Kaelen screamed, decapitating a zombie that lunged at his horse.

He was in the center of the fray, leading a squad of heavy infantry. The smell was atrocious—rotting flesh, blood, and ozone. The sky was dark, choked by the smoke of burning siege engines.

"They're pushing the left flank!" Lyra shouted from atop a pile of corpses. She was picking off enemy commanders with terrifying precision. "The Orcs are buckling!"

Kaelen looked left. The Orc line was submerged in a tide of Ghouls.

"Drakon! Go left!" Kaelen ordered.

"With pleasure!" Drakon roared. He charged into the mass of demons like a bowling ball. "I am a dragon! Hear me roar!"

He breathed fire, clearing a twenty-foot circle. The heat was intense, singing eyebrows fifty feet away. The Orcs, seeing the giant lizard-man incinerating their enemies, rallied. "For the Lizard!" they shouted (much to Drakon's delight).

But for every demon they killed, two more took its place. Necromancers in the back lines were raising the fallen. The dead soldiers were standing up, their eyes glowing green, turning on their former comrades.

"We need to kill the summoners!" Elfiria shouted. She was hovering on a disc of light, blasting undead with holy bolts. Her face was pale with strain.

"We can't reach them!" Kaelen parried a blow from a Shadow Knight. "The lines are too thick!"

"Aric!" Kaelen looked to the center.

Aric was cutting a path. He was a beacon. Every swing of *Dawnbringer* vaporized demons. He wasn't fighting; he was dancing. He was heading straight for the Throne.

"Push forward!" Kaelen rallied his men. "Follow the Saint! Don't let him fight alone!"

## Part 2: The Duel of Fate

Aric reached the base of the skull throne. The ground here was paved with obsidian.

Malakor leaped down to meet him. The impact shook the valley.

"Round two," Malakor growled, igniting his sword with black fire. "No tricks this time. Just steel."

"You look better," Aric quipped, dodging a strike that cracked the earth. "Did you get a new helmet? It shines."

"Die!" Malakor swung wildly.

Aric was calm. He flowed around the attacks. *Water Style.* He deflected the massive greatsword with a flick of his wrist, using Malakor's own strength against him.

*System Alert: Combat Analysis.*
*Target: Demon General Malakor.*
*Threat Level: High.*
*Aric Status: Peak Condition.*

"You are strong," Aric said, dancing back. "But you are angry. Anger makes you blind."

Aric stepped in. *Flash Strike.*

*Dawnbringer* cut through Malakor's breastplate. A shallow cut, but it burned with holy fire. Smoke rose from the wound.

"Argh!" Malakor roared. He summoned a storm of Hellfire.

"Solar Aegis!" Aric slammed his hand on the ground. A dome of light protected him. The fire washed over it harmlessly.

"My turn," Aric said.

He charged. He unleashed a flurry of blows. *High. Low. Feint. Strike.*

Malakor couldn't keep up. He was being dismantled piece by piece. His armor shattered. His sword was knocked from his hand. He fell to his knees.

Aric pointed *Dawnbringer* at Malakor's throat.

"Yield," Aric commanded. "The Light offers mercy."

"Yield?" Malakor laughed, spitting black blood. "We do not yield. We consume."

"King!" Malakor shouted. "Help me!"

The Demon King sighed. "Disappointing."

## Part 3: The King Moves

Azezel stood up.

The battlefield went silent. The air pressure dropped. Soldiers fell to their knees, vomiting. Even the demons cowered. Birds fell from the sky, dead.

"Gravity magic?" Kaelen gasped, struggling to stay upright. His knees hit the mud.

*System Alert: Aura of Despair Detected.*
*Effect: All Stats -50%.*
*Movement Speed: -80%.*
*Sanity Check: Failed.*

Azezel floated down from the throne. He landed in front of Aric.

"So," Azezel said. His voice wasn't loud, but it echoed in everyone's head. "You are the hope of this world."

"I am Aric," the Sword Saint stood tall, resisting the gravity. "And you are trespassing."

"Am I?" Azezel smiled. "I am simply... pruning the garden."

He raised a hand. A sphere of pure darkness formed. It was a hole in reality.

"Void Blast."

He flicked it at Aric.

Aric raised *Dawnbringer*. "Grand Cross!"

He slashed. A cross of holy light met the void sphere.

*BOOM.*

The explosion was blinding. The shockwave knocked Kaelen off his feet.

When the dust cleared, Aric was still standing. But he was panting. *Dawnbringer* was glowing dimmer.

"Impressive," Azezel clapped slowly. "You survived a cantrip."

"A cantrip?" Aric's eyes widened. "That was... Class S magic."

"Let me show you a spell," Azezel said.

He chanted in a language that hurt the ears. The sky turned black. A massive hand of shadow formed in the clouds.

"Titan's Grasp."

The hand descended. It was the size of a mountain.

"Aric! Run!" Kaelen screamed.

Aric looked back at the army. If he ran, the hand would crush them. Fifty thousand lives.

"No," Aric whispered.

He stabbed his sword into the ground. "Final Art: Supernova."

He ignited his life force. He became a sun.

The light pushed back the shadow hand. It burned the demons nearby. It was beautiful.

But Azezel just laughed.

He walked *into* the light. The holy fire licked at his skin, but he didn't burn. He grabbed Aric by the throat.

The light flickered. And died.

"Your light is finite," Azezel whispered to the choking hero. "The Void is eternal."

He squeezed.

*CRACK.*

It was a sound that ended an era.

Aric went limp. Azezel dropped him.

The Sword Saint fell into the mud. Dead.

## Part 4: The Rout

"No..." Elfiria whispered. Her disc faded, and she fell to the ground.

The army saw it. They saw the sun go out.

"He's dead!" someone screamed. "The Hero is dead!"

Panic. Instant, primal panic.

The lines broke. Soldiers threw down their weapons and ran. It wasn't a retreat; it was a stampede.

"Kill them all," Azezel ordered, returning to his throne.

The demons surged forward.

"Kaelen! We have to go!" Lyra was pulling at him.

Kaelen was staring at Aric's body. "We can't leave him."

"He's gone, Kaelen!" Drakon grabbed him. "Look around! We are being flanked!"

The ghouls were swarming. The Orcs were dead. The General was dead.

"Elfiria!" Kaelen shook himself out of the shock. "Get the Princess!"

They fought their way to Elfiria. She was catatonic, staring at the battlefield.

Kaelen grabbed her, throwing her onto a loose horse. He jumped on behind her.

"Ride!"

They joined the river of fleeing soldiers. The demons nipped at their heels like wolves.

Kaelen looked back one last time. He saw Aric's body, a speck of gold in a sea of black, being swallowed by the horde.

The Age of Heroes was over. The Age of Survival had begun.

*System Alert: Chapter Completed.*
*World State Update: Aric Deceased. Alliance Army Routed. Quest Failed.*
*Party Status: Retreating. Morale: Broken.*
