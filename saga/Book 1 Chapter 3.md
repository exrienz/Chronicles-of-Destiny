# Chapter 3: The First Spark

## Part 1: The Depths of Despair

The water of the canal was cold enough to steal the breath from a man's lungs, and dirty enough to make him wish he hadn't taken that breath in the first place. Kaelen, Lyra, and Drakon had drifted with the current for what felt like an eternity, swept under stone bridges and past the darkened windows of the sleeping city, until the flow deposited them into the overflow tunnels of the sewers.

They dragged themselves onto a slick, stone walkway, coughing and sputtering. The air here was thick, smelling of rot and ancient damp.

"I hate this," Lyra announced, her voice echoing in the gloom. She stood up, wringing out her long green braid. A stream of dark water splashed onto the stones. "I hate water. I hate sewers. And I am starting to develop a very strong dislike for you, Kaelen."

Kaelen leaned against the curved wall, checking his status.

*System Alert: Body Temperature Low. Risk of Hypothermia: Moderate.*
*Status Effect: Foul Stench (Charisma -5).*

"It was the only way out," Kaelen rasped, shivering slightly. "Captain Thorne would have killed us on that roof."

"Thorne..." Drakon rumbled. The dragon-man shook himself like a massive dog, sending a spray of dirty water flying everywhere. Lyra shrieked and ducked behind Kaelen. "That man... he was not right. His smell was wrong. Like burnt sugar and old blood."

"He's corrupted," Kaelen confirmed. "The Void magic. It twists people. Makes them stronger, faster, but... hollow."

"Well, he's dry," Lyra muttered, peeling her sodden leather vest away from her skin. "And we are not. Look at this! Do you know how much this leather cost? It's ruined!"

"We're alive," Kaelen reminded her. "Focus on that."

"I am focusing on the fact that I am wet, cold, and in a sewer," Lyra snapped. She sat down on a relatively dry patch of moss, pulling off her boots to empty the water. "We need a plan. A real plan. Not 'jump off a building and hope Drakon floats'."

"I do float!" Drakon said proudly. "It is my lung capacity. Very large."

Kaelen paced the small walkway. The tunnel stretched out in both directions into darkness.

*System Scan: Mapping Environment.*
*North: Main Sewer Line (Leads to Harbor).*
*South: Maintenance Shaft (Leads to Surface - Lower Slums).*

"We need to get to the surface," Kaelen said. "The sewers will lead us out of the city, eventually, but we'll be blind. We need to know what's happening up there."

"They'll be looking for us," Lyra pointed out. "We're the most wanted people in Arcanis right now."

"Exactly," Kaelen said. "Which means they'll expect us to run. To hide. They won't expect us to head *towards* the palace."

Lyra stared at him. "You want to go back? Are you suicidal? Or just stupid?"

"We have the letter," Kaelen said, tapping the scroll case Lyra still clutched. "But a letter is just paper. We need to deliver it. And we need to stop the war declaration."

"The declaration is probably happening right now," Lyra argued. "While we're down here playing with rats."

As if on cue, a large rat scurried past Drakon's foot. The dragon-man looked at it hungrily.

"Do not eat the sewer rat," Lyra warned.

Drakon sighed. "Fine."

"We go up," Kaelen decided. "We stick to the rooftops. We get to the plaza. If we can expose the corruption publicly... maybe we can stop the madness."

"And if we can't?" Lyra asked softly.

"Then we go down fighting," Kaelen said.

Lyra looked at him for a long moment. Then she sighed, pulling her boots back on. "You really are a hero type, aren't you? It's exhausting."

"Come on," Kaelen offered her a hand.

She took it. "Fine. But if we survive this, you're buying me a new outfit. Silk. Imported."

"Deal."

They moved towards the maintenance ladder, climbing up towards the grate that filtered the moonlight from the street above. Kaelen pushed the grate open. It was heavy, rusted.

They emerged into a back alley in the Lower Slums. The air here was only marginally better than the sewers, smelling of fish guts and poverty, but at least it wasn't confined.

But as they stood up, the sounds of the city washed over them. Shouts. Running feet. The clank of armor. The chase wasn't over; the patrols were everywhere.

"We need higher ground," Kaelen said, pointing to a dilapidated tenement building. "To the roof."

They scrambled up the fire escape, the rusted metal groaning under Drakon's weight. By the time they reached the slate tiles of the roof, they could see the torches of the City Watch swarming the streets below like angry fireflies.

"It's starting," Kaelen said.

## Part 2: The Dance of Gravity

The sun had fully set now, but the city was lit by the orange glow of torches and the magical lights of the chase.

"I hate this!" Drakon yelled, his heavy boots cracking a terracotta roof tile as he landed with the grace of a falling boulder. He stumbled, his massive tail swinging wildly to regain balance, smashing a chimney pot into dust. "I am built for battlefields, for solid earth! Not for... hopping like a demented rabbit!"

"Keep moving!" Kaelen shouted back, vaulting over a chimney stack with practiced ease. "They're right behind us!"

They were being hunted. Not by four assassins this time, but by a swarm. The 'First Spark'—the event Kaelen had feared—was happening. The Shadow agents had dropped all pretense of subtlety. They wanted the letter, and they were willing to burn the city down to get it.

Behind them, leaping across the gaps between buildings with unnatural, fluid grace, were a dozen figures in black. They moved like a single organism, a tide of darkness flowing over the rooftops. Their movements were silent, a stark contrast to Drakon’s crashing progress.

Kaelen glanced back. The System highlighted the pursuers in red outlines, tracking their vectors.

*Enemy Analysis: Elite Shadow Stalkers. Speed: High. Threat: Critical.*
*Projected Intercept Time: 30 seconds.*

"There's too many of them!" Lyra called out. She was in her element here, light and agile, skipping across the perilous drops with ease despite her sodden clothes. She paused on a high gable, spun around, and leveled her crossbow. Her green hair whipped around her face, plastering to her cheek.

*Thwip.*

The bolt flew true, striking the lead pursuer in the chest. The assassin fell without a sound, tumbling off the roof and into the street far below. But two more took his place instantly, flowing over the corpse like water around a stone.

"They don't stop," Lyra muttered, reloading with trembling hands. "They don't even slow down."

"We need to break line of sight!" Kaelen ordered, his eyes scanning the terrain. The "System" overlaid a green path on his vision—the optimal route. It zigzagged across the rooftops, utilizing washing lines, balconies, and loose tiles. "Head for the Market District! The awnings will give us cover!"

They veered right, scrambling up a steep slate roof. The tiles were slick with moss and the evening damp. Kaelen slipped, his fingers scrabbling for purchase.

*System Warning: Traction Loss. Grip Strength Failing.*

He gritted his teeth and dug his boots into the gutter, propelling himself upward. He reached the peak and looked down. The Market District was a chaotic sea of colorful tents and stalls fifty feet below. The drop was significant—deadly for anyone without magic or insanity.

"Jump!" Kaelen commanded.

"Are you insane?" Lyra shrieked, skidding to a halt at the edge. She looked down at the kaleidoscope of colors below. "That's a fifty-foot drop! I'm a rogue, not a bird! And I just got dry!"

"Trust me!" Kaelen grabbed her hand. Her skin was cool, despite the heat of the chase. He squeezed it reassuringly. "Aim for the fruit stalls! They're softer!"

He didn't wait. He leaped into the void, pulling her with him.

For a second, they were weightless. The wind roared in his ears. He saw Lyra squeeze her eyes shut, a scream trapped in her throat. Below them, the world rushed up to meet them.

*System Calculation: Impact Force Analysis.*
*Target: Canvas Awning (Tensile Strength: Low).*
*Secondary Target: Melon Cart (Density: Low).*
*Survival Probability: 89%.*

He hit the canvas awning of a fruit stall.

*Rip.*

He crashed through the fabric, slowing his fall, then hit a second awning, and finally tumbled into a pile of cabbages. The smell of crushed vegetation filled his nose.

"My cabbages!" a merchant wailed, throwing his hands up in despair. "My beautiful, prize-winning cabbages!"

Lyra landed next to him a second later, rolling perfectly to absorb the impact. She ended up in a crate of melons.

"Sticky," she complained, wiping fruit juice from her cheek. She looked at Kaelen, her eyes wide, adrenaline dilating her pupils. "You are insane. Officially. Remind me to never let you make the travel plans again."

A massive crash shook the ground as Drakon landed. He didn't hit an awning. He hit a cart full of pottery. The cart disintegrated into dust and shards.

"I am unhurt!" Drakon announced, rising from the rubble like a titan. He dusted off his shoulder. "Though this clay is of poor quality. And I believe I have a shard in my..." He paused, wiggling his tail. "Never mind. It is gone."

"Go! Go!" Kaelen grabbed Lyra’s arm, pulling her out of the melons.

They sprinted through the market, knocking over displays and dodging angry shoppers. The assassins were raining down from the roofs now, landing in the crowd, causing panic. Screams erupted. The chase had turned into a riot.

"They don't care about collateral damage," Lyra panted as they ducked into a side street. "They're attacking civilians just to slow us down!"

"They want chaos," Kaelen said grimly. "Chaos covers their tracks. It makes the guards confused. It makes everyone an enemy."

He looked back. An assassin had landed on a stall, kicking a merchant in the face. The cruelty was pointless, performative.

"We can't just leave them," Drakon growled, stopping. "They are hurting innocents!"

"We have to!" Kaelen urged, though it tasted like bile in his throat. "If we stop, we die. And if we die, the war starts. Think of the bigger picture, Drakon!"

Drakon hesitated, his fists clenched. Then, with a frustrated roar, he turned and followed.

They hid behind a stack of crates as a patrol of guards ran past, their swords drawn. Kaelen held his breath, his hand over Lyra's mouth to keep her quiet. She glared at him but didn't move. Her breathing was ragged against his palm.

"We need to get to the palace," Kaelen whispered once the guards were gone. "But the main streets are blocked."

"The sewers?" Drakon suggested.

"No," Lyra said immediately. "Absolutely not. I draw the line at sewage. My boots are new. And I already smell like cabbages and canal water."

"Then we fight our way through the plaza," Kaelen said. "It's the only way."

***

## Part 3: The Mage of Plaza

They moved carefully, using the shadows. The city felt different now. Hostile. Every alleyway seemed to hide a threat. Kaelen's System was constantly pinging with potential dangers.

*Motion detected. Heat signature detected. Hostile intent: Likely.*

They reached the main plaza, a vast open space dominated by a massive fountain depicting the First King slaying a hydra. Usually, it was a place of celebration. Tonight, it was a killing field.

Standing in the center of the plaza, surrounded by terrified citizens who were fleeing towards the edges, was a man in flowing purple robes. He held a staff topped with a pulsating black crystal. His face was hidden by a hood, but his voice... his voice was amplified by magic, booming across the square like the voice of a god.

"Give it up, carrier!" the mage shouted. "There is nowhere to run! The city is sealed! The barriers are erected! You are rats in a trap!"

Kaelen skidded to a halt. "A Shadow Mage. Great. Just what we needed."

The mage slammed his staff into the ground. A shockwave of dark energy rippled out, shattering the cobblestones and sending a cloud of dust into the air.

"I shall handle the tiny wizard!" Drakon declared. "He looks breakable!"

"Drakon, wait!" Kaelen warned. "Magic is unpredictable! That crystal... it's void-infused!"

But Drakon was already charging. "I can breach anything!" he roared. He lowered his scale-armored shoulder like a battering ram, his feet tearing up the pavement.

The mage sneered and flicked his wrist. "Foolish beast."

A wall of purple fire erupted in front of Drakon, sizzling and popping with dark energy. The heat was intense, singeing Kaelen's eyebrows from fifty feet away.

Drakon didn't stop. He ran straight through the fire.

"What?" The mage’s eyes went wide. "That is impossible! That is Hellfire!"

"Dragon scales are fireproof, you ignorant spell-flinger!" Drakon laughed, emerging from the flames wreathed in smoke but unharmed. He smashed into the mage with the force of a runaway siege engine.

The impact sent the mage flying into the fountain. The dark fire dissipated instantly.

"Nice hit," Lyra whistled. "Remind me never to arm wrestle you."

"Don't celebrate yet," Kaelen pointed.

The mage rose from the water. He wasn't unconscious. He was laughing. A horrible, gurgling laugh.

"You think physical force matters?" the mage wheezed. He raised his staff. The water in the fountain turned black. It began to rise, forming into shapes. Tentacles of dark water lashed out.

"Rise, servants of the deep!"

*System Alert: Summoning Ritual Detected.*
*Entities: Void Water Elementals (Level 10).*

Three massive, shapeless forms rose from the fountain. They had no eyes, only gaping maws of swirling water.

"Drakon, look out!" Kaelen sprinted forward, drawing his swords.

One of the elementals lashed out a watery limb, striking Drakon in the chest. The dragon-man was thrown back, skidding across the plaza.

"They hit hard!" Drakon grunted, getting up.

"Lyra, target the mage!" Kaelen shouted. "He's controlling them!"

"I'm on it!" Lyra darted to the side, looking for a clear shot.

Kaelen engaged the nearest elemental. He slashed at it, but his blade passed harmlessly through the water.

*System Advice: Physical attacks ineffective. Disruption of core required.*

"Aim for the center!" Kaelen yelled. "They have cores!"

He saw a faint purple glow in the center of the swirling mass. He dodged a slam attack, rolling under the elemental's arm. He thrust upward, channeling mana into his blade.

*Skill: Mana Spike.*

The blue energy of his sword disrupted the magical cohesion. The elemental exploded into a puddle of ordinary water.

"One down!"

But the mage was casting again. He pointed his staff at Lyra. A bolt of black lightning arced towards her.

Lyra dove, the lightning scorching the ground where she had stood. She rolled to her feet and fired.

The bolt hit the mage in the shoulder. He screamed, dropping his staff. The remaining elementals faltered.

"Now, Drakon!" Kaelen commanded.

Drakon picked up a heavy stone bench. "Batter up!"

He swung the bench like a club, smashing the second elemental. The core shattered.

The mage scrambled back, clutching his bleeding shoulder. "You... you cannot stop what is coming! The gears are already turning!"

"Maybe," Kaelen said, walking up to him, sword raised. "But you won't be here to see it."

Before he could strike, an arrow flew from the shadows, striking the mage in the throat. He gurgled and fell, dead.

"Who did that?" Lyra asked, spinning around.

From the side streets, more figures were emerging. But these weren't assassins. They were soldiers. Royal Guards. Dozens of them. But their eyes... they had that same cold, glassy look as the ones in the tavern.

"Cleaning up loose ends again," Kaelen realized. "They didn't want him talking."

"Mind control?" Lyra asked, horrified. "Or just corruption?"

"A bit of both, I suspect," Kaelen said, drawing his swords. "We're trapped."

***

## Part 4: The Truth Revealed

They were surrounded. On one side, the remaining Shadow Assassins dropped from the roofs. On the other, the corrupted Royal Guard advanced with shields raised. The plaza was a kill box.

"We fight," Kaelen said, stepping back until his shoulder brushed Drakon's armor. "Back to back."

They formed a tight triangle. Kaelen facing the guards, Drakon facing the assassins, Lyra in the center covering the flanks with her crossbow.

"This is going to be a good death!" Drakon declared, loosening his massive war-axe from his back. "I shall sing of it in the afterlife! The ballad of the Dragon and his tiny friends!"

"Let's try to sing about it in a pub later tonight instead," Lyra suggested, her hands trembling slightly as she reloaded. "I prefer wine to valhalla."

The enemy charged.

It was a blur of steel and magic. Kaelen fought with a desperation he hadn't felt in years. He parried, slashed, and dodged. The guards were skilled, trained soldiers. He didn't want to kill them—they were his countrymen, potentially under a spell—but they gave him no choice.

*System Alert: Stamina draining rapidly. Adrenaline levels critical.*
*Parry success rate: 85%. Evasion rate: 70%.*

He aimed for non-lethal strikes where he could—pommel smashes to the temple, knee-capping kicks—but the sheer number of them was overwhelming. A spear grazed his cheek. A sword hammered against his parrying dagger.

"They're not stopping!" Kaelen gritted out. "They're fighting like zombies!"

"Lyra! The letter!" Kaelen shouted over the din of battle, parrying a spear thrust. "Is it safe?"

"It's in my corset!" she yelled back, firing a bolt into a guard's shoulder. "Unless they're getting very fresh, it's safe! And if they try, I'll bite them!"

"Focus!" Drakon roared, cleaving a shield in two with his axe. "There are too many!"

Suddenly, a horn blast cut through the noise. It was a deep, resonant sound that seemed to shake the very air.

The fighting stopped. Everyone looked up.

On the balcony of the Royal Palace, overlooking the plaza, a figure stood. It was a herald, dressed in black and silver, flanked by two high-ranking generals. The royal banner draped over the railing, but it looked limp, lifeless.

"Citizens of Arcanis!" the herald announced. His voice was projected magically, reaching every corner of the plaza. "Hear the Royal Decree!"

The crowd, cowering in doorways, looked up. Even the corrupted guards paused, as if waiting for a command.

"Due to the cowardly attack on our border villages..." the herald paused for effect. "...and the confirmed evidence of aggression... The Kingdom of Eldoria hereby declares WAR on the Kingdom of Aridia!"

Kaelen froze. His sword tip lowered.

"No," he whispered. "We were too late."

The herald continued, his voice rising in fervor. "General Malakor has already been dispatched to the front! The King commands all able-bodied men to report to the recruitment centers! Victory for Eldoria! Death to the invaders!"

A cheer went up from the confused crowd. War fever. It was infectious. They didn't know it was a lie. They didn't know they were cheering for their own doom. They just heard 'Victory' and 'War' and let their fear turn into aggression.

"Yeah! Kill them all!" a baker shouted, raising a rolling pin.

"For the King!" another cried.

The assassins and guards in the plaza slowly backed away, melting into the cheering crowd. Their job was done. The distraction had worked. The war was started. Kaelen and his friends were no longer the priority; the chaos of mobilization would cover everything.

"We failed," Lyra said, lowering her crossbow. Her voice was hollow. She looked small suddenly. "All that running. All that fighting. For nothing."

Kaelen sheathed his swords. He felt a heavy weight settle in his gut. The letter... it was useless now. The declaration had been made. The armies would march.

"It was a setup," Kaelen realized. "The chase... the assassins... it was all to keep us busy while they pushed the decree through. We were just pawns. A distraction."

Drakon looked around, confused. "But... we have the proof! The letter says it is a lie! Why do they cheer?"

"Because they are afraid," Kaelen said bitterly. "And fear makes people stupid. Once the war drums start beating, nobody listens to a piece of paper. The momentum is unstoppable."

He looked up at the palace balcony. The herald was gone. But Kaelen saw a shadow moving behind the curtains. A figure watching them. A figure with burning red eyes.

*System Alert: High Threat Detected. Demon Class Entity.*
*Power Level: Unknown (Extremely High).*
*Warning: Do not engage.*

"This isn't over," Kaelen vowed. "They started their war. But they made a mistake."

"What mistake?" Lyra asked, looking at him with concern.

"They let us live," Kaelen said. "Come on. We need to leave the city. Arcanis isn't safe anymore."

***

## Part 5: The Road of Ruin

The escape from Arcanis was surprisingly easy, yet harrowing in its implications. With the war announcement, the gates were thrown open for military convoys. Kaelen, Lyra, and Drakon slipped out amidst a column of supply wagons, disguised in stolen cloaks they had scavenged from a washing line.

The road leading away from the capital, usually a picturesque trade route lined with oak trees, was now a river of misery. It was filled with refugees—people fleeing the capital in fear of reprisal attacks or simply caught up in the panic—and soldiers marching towards the border.

The group kept their heads down, moving with the flow. They walked for hours, putting the gleaming city behind them, but the sense of dread only grew.

"Look at them," Drakon whispered, his voice unusually soft.

He pointed to a family sitting by the roadside. A mother was bandaging a child's knee, while the father tried to fix a broken wheel on their cart. They looked terrified, their eyes darting at every passing soldier.

"They think the Aridians are coming to eat them," Lyra said, shaking her head. "The propaganda works fast."

"It's not just propaganda," Kaelen noted, his eyes scanning the horizon. "Look at the smoke."

In the distance, black plumes rose from several villages.

"Raiding parties?" Drakon asked, reaching for his axe.

"Shadows," Kaelen corrected. "Creating chaos. Making sure the anger stays hot."

As they passed a bend in the road, they came upon a chaotic scene. A military checkpoint had been set up, but it wasn't orderly. A group of soldiers, looking ragged and aggressive, were harassing a merchant caravan.

"You can't take my grain!" the merchant pleaded. "It's all I have!"

"War tax," a soldier spat, shoving the man into the mud. "Everything belongs to the King now."

Drakon growled low in his throat. "This is not honor. This is theft."

"Keep walking," Kaelen hissed. "We can't get involved. We're fugitives."

"But—"

"If we fight them, we reveal ourselves," Kaelen said. "And we delay our mission."

But fate, it seemed, had other plans.

One of the soldiers, a brute with a scarred face, noticed Lyra. He grinned, revealing yellow teeth.

"Well, well," he leered, stepping into their path. "What do we have here? A little elf wandering so far from the woods?"

Lyra stiffened. "I'm just a traveler, sir. Moving along."

"Travelers pay a toll," the soldier said, reaching out to grab her arm. "And pretty travelers pay double."

Kaelen felt the world slow down. *System Alert: Hostile Action Imminent.*

He didn't draw his sword. That would be too conspicuous. Instead, he stepped between Lyra and the soldier.

"She's with me," Kaelen said, his voice calm but cold. "And we have no money."

The soldier laughed. "And who are you? Her pimp?"

He went to shove Kaelen.

Kaelen caught the man's wrist. With a subtle twist and a shift of weight, he used the soldier's own momentum against him. There was a sickening *crack*, and the soldier screamed as his arm broke. Kaelen kicked him in the knee, sending him face-first into the dirt.

"Move," Kaelen ordered his friends.

The other soldiers drew their weapons. "Get them!"

"Oh, for the love of..." Lyra sighed, dropping her disguise. "I was trying to be good!"

She spun, kicking a soldier in the groin, then vaulted over him to punch another in the throat.

Drakon simply roared, shedding his cloak. The sight of a seven-foot dragon-man in full armor froze the soldiers in their tracks.

"BOO!" Drakon shouted.

Three soldiers dropped their weapons and ran.

"Cowards!" Drakon yelled after them.

They made short work of the rest, knocking them unconscious rather than killing them. The merchant stared at them, wide-eyed.

"Thank you," he stammered. "Who... who are you?"

"Nobody," Kaelen said. "Just travelers."

They hurried away before reinforcements could arrive, leaving the road and cutting through the woods.

***

## Part 6: Embers in the Dark

As night fell, they made camp deep in a grove of trees, far from the road. The fire crackled, casting dancing shadows on their faces. The adrenaline of the fight had faded, replaced by exhaustion.

Drakon started a fire, roasting a rabbit he had caught with impressive dexterity for someone with such large hands. Lyra sat polishing her bolts, her usual humor absent.

Kaelen sat staring into the flames. He felt the weight of failure. He had the letter. He had the skills. And yet, the world was burning anyway.

"So," Lyra said finally, breaking the silence. She didn't look up from her crossbow. "We're going to war. I didn't sign up for this, you know. I signed up for... well, I didn't sign up for anything. I just wanted some wine. And maybe some fun."

"You can leave," Kaelen said without looking up. "Go back to the city. Hide. Survive."

Lyra looked at him. She stopped polishing. "Is that what you want? To be the lone wolf again? Dying heroically in a ditch somewhere?"

"It's safer for you," Kaelen said.

Lyra scoffed. She crawled over to him, sitting beside him on the log. She bumped his shoulder with hers. "Safer? Maybe. But boring. And I hate being bored."

She sighed and leaned back, looking up at the stars. "Besides. If what you say is true... about the Shadows and the Demon King... there's nowhere to hide, is there?"

"No," Kaelen said. "There isn't."

"Then I stick with the big guy," she pointed at Drakon. "He seems durable."

Drakon beamed, tearing a leg off the rabbit. "I am very durable! And I have decided... I like this 'party'. You are small and squishy, but you fight well. We shall be... the Dragon's Fangs!"

"We are not calling ourselves that," Lyra said immediately.

"The Scale Breakers?"

"No."

"The Hungry Trio?"

"Better," Lyra admitted, smiling slightly. "But still no."

Kaelen smiled. A faint, tired smile. He looked at Lyra. In the firelight, she looked softer, less guarded.

"Why do you really stay, Lyra?" Kaelen asked softly. "It's not just boredom."

Lyra hesitated. She traced the grain of the wood on her crossbow. "My sister... she was a mage. Talented. She went to the academy in the capital. She sent letters home every week. And then... the letters stopped. I went to find her. They said she died in an 'accident'. But I saw the body. There were... marks. Runes. Like the ones on that mage in the plaza."

She looked up at Kaelen, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. "I want to know who killed her. And I think... I think it's the same people chasing you."

Kaelen nodded slowly. "We'll find them. I promise."

"I know," Lyra said. She leaned closer. "And... I think you might need someone to watch your back. You have a habit of jumping off roofs."

"It's a tactical maneuver," Kaelen defended.

"It's a death wish," Lyra corrected.

She placed her hand on his arm. The touch was warm, grounding. Kaelen felt a strange fluttering in his chest that had nothing to do with the System.

"Thank you," he said quietly.

"For what?"

"For staying."

Lyra held his gaze. For a moment, the banter stopped. There was just the crackle of the fire and the shared understanding of two people standing on the edge of a precipice.

"Don't make me regret it, hero," she whispered.

She leaned in, and for a second, Kaelen thought she might kiss him. The tension was palpable, a magnetic pull. Her lips were parted, her eyes searching his. The scent of pine and rain on her skin was intoxicating.

But then Drakon let out a massive belch.

"Excuse me!" Drakon announced. "The rabbit was rich."

Lyra burst out laughing, the moment broken but the warmth remaining. She punched Drakon lightly on the arm. "You really know how to ruin a moment, lizard."

"I do not understand," Drakon said, confused. "Was there a moment? I was eating."

Kaelen chuckled, shaking his head.

"Get some rest," he told them. "Tomorrow, we reach the border. And tomorrow, we see what this war really looks like."

He looked up at the stars. Somewhere out there, the pieces were moving. The Demon Generals were waking up. The Alliance was fracturing before it even formed.

But as he looked at his companions—a snoring dragon and an elf checking her nails—he felt a spark of hope.

It wasn't the Alliance of Light yet. But it was a start.
