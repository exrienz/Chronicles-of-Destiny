# Chapter 3: The First Spark

## Part 1: The Dance of Gravity

The sun was dipping below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of bruised purple and blood red—a fitting backdrop for the chaos unfolding in Arcanis. The rooftops of the city stretched out like a jagged sea of slate and tile, a dangerous, undulating playground for those desperate enough to traverse it. The wind whipped past them, carrying the scent of smoke from the burning safe house and the sharper, metallic tang of imminent rain.

"I hate this!" Drakon yelled, his heavy boots cracking a terracotta roof tile as he landed with the grace of a falling boulder. He stumbled, his massive tail swinging wildly to regain balance, smashing a chimney pot into dust. "I am built for battlefields, for solid earth! Not for... hopping like a demented rabbit!"

"Keep moving!" Kaelen shouted back, vaulting over a chimney stack with practiced ease. His breath came in ragged gasps, but his movements were fluid. "They're right behind us!"

They were being hunted. Not by four assassins this time, but by a swarm. The 'First Spark'—the event Kaelen had feared—was happening. The Shadow agents had dropped all pretense of subtlety. They wanted the letter, and they were willing to burn the city down to get it.

Behind them, leaping across the gaps between buildings with unnatural, fluid grace, were a dozen figures in black. They moved like a single organism, a tide of darkness flowing over the rooftops. Their movements were silent, a stark contrast to Drakon’s crashing progress.

Kaelen glanced back. The System highlighted the pursuers in red outlines.

*Enemy Analysis: Elite Shadow Stalkers. Speed: High. Threat: Critical.*

"There's too many of them!" Lyra called out. She was in her element here, light and agile, skipping across the perilous drops with ease. She paused on a high gable, spun around, and leveled her crossbow. Her green hair whipped around her face.

*Thwip.*

The bolt flew true, striking the lead pursuer in the chest. The assassin fell without a sound, tumbling off the roof and into the street far below. But two more took his place instantly, flowing over the corpse like water around a stone.

"We need to break line of sight!" Kaelen ordered, his eyes scanning the terrain. The "System" overlaid a green path on his vision—the optimal route. It zigzagged across the rooftops, utilizing washing lines, balconies, and loose tiles. "Head for the Market District! The awnings will give us cover!"

They veered right, scrambling up a steep slate roof. Kaelen reached the peak and looked down. The Market District was a chaotic sea of colorful tents and stalls fifty feet below. The drop was significant—deadly for anyone without magic or insanity.

"Jump!" Kaelen commanded.

"Are you insane?" Lyra shrieked, skidding to a halt at the edge. She looked down at the kaleidoscope of colors below. "That's a fifty-foot drop! I'm a rogue, not a bird!"

"Trust me!" Kaelen grabbed her hand. Her skin was cool, despite the heat of the chase. He squeezed it reassuringly. "Aim for the fruit stalls! They're softer!"

He didn't wait. He leaped into the void, pulling her with him.

For a second, they were weightless. The wind roared in his ears. He saw Lyra squeeze her eyes shut, a scream trapped in her throat. Below them, the world rushed up to meet them.

*Impact in 3... 2... 1...*

He hit the canvas awning of a fruit stall.

*Rip.*

He crashed through the fabric, slowing his fall, then hit a second awning, and finally tumbled into a pile of cabbages. The smell of crushed vegetation filled his nose.

"My cabbages!" a merchant wailed, throwing his hands up in despair. "My beautiful, prize-winning cabbages!"

Lyra landed next to him a second later, rolling perfectly to absorb the impact. She ended up in a crate of melons.

"Sticky," she complained, wiping fruit juice from her cheek. She looked at Kaelen, her eyes wide, adrenaline dilating her pupils. "You are insane. Officially. Remind me to never let you make the travel plans again."

A massive crash shook the ground as Drakon landed. He didn't hit an awning. He hit a cart full of pottery. The cart disintegrated into dust and shards.

"I am unhurt!" Drakon announced, rising from the rubble like a titan. He dusted off his shoulder. "Though this clay is of poor quality. And I believe I have a shard in my..." He paused, wiggling his tail. "Never mind. It is gone."

"Go! Go!" Kaelen grabbed Lyra’s arm, pulling her out of the melons.

They sprinted through the market, knocking over displays and dodging angry shoppers. The assassins were raining down from the roofs now, landing in the crowd, causing panic. Screams erupted. The chase had turned into a riot.

"They don't care about collateral damage," Lyra panted as they ducked into a side street. "They're attacking civilians just to slow us down!"

"They want chaos," Kaelen said grimly. "Chaos covers their tracks. It makes the guards confused. It makes everyone an enemy."

They hid behind a stack of crates as a patrol of guards ran past, their swords drawn. Kaelen held his breath, his hand over Lyra's mouth to keep her quiet. She glared at him but didn't move.

"We need to get to the palace," Kaelen whispered once the guards were gone. "But the main streets are blocked."

"The sewers?" Drakon suggested.

"No," Lyra said immediately. "Absolutely not. I draw the line at sewage. My boots are new."

"Then we fight our way through the plaza," Kaelen said. "It's the only way."

## Part 2: The Mage of Plaza

They moved carefully, using the shadows. But as they reached the main plaza, a vast open space dominated by a massive fountain and the statue of the First King, they realized their mistake.

Their path was blocked.

Standing in the center of the plaza, surrounded by terrified citizens who were fleeing towards the edges, was a man in flowing purple robes. He held a staff topped with a pulsating black crystal. His face was hidden by a hood, but his voice... his voice was amplified by magic, booming across the square like the voice of a god.

"Give it up, carrier!" the mage shouted. "There is nowhere to run! The city is sealed! The barriers are erected! You are rats in a trap!"

Kaelen skidded to a halt. "A Shadow Mage. Great. Just what we needed."

The mage slammed his staff into the ground. A shockwave of dark energy rippled out, shattering the cobblestones and sending a cloud of dust into the air.

"I shall handle the tiny wizard!" Drakon declared. "He looks breakable!"

"Drakon, wait!" Kaelen warned. "Magic is unpredictable!"

But Drakon was already charging. "I can breach anything!" he roared. He lowered his scale-armored shoulder like a battering ram, his feet tearing up the pavement.

The mage sneered and flicked his wrist. A wall of purple fire erupted in front of Drakon, sizzling and popping with dark energy. The heat was intense, singeing Kaelen's eyebrows from fifty feet away.

Drakon didn't stop. He ran straight through the fire.

"What?" The mage’s eyes went wide. "That is impossible! That is Hellfire!"

"Dragon scales are fireproof, you ignorant spell-flinger!" Drakon laughed, emerging from the flames wreathed in smoke but unharmed. He smashed into the mage with the force of a runaway siege engine.

The impact sent the mage flying into the fountain. The dark fire dissipated instantly.

"Nice hit," Lyra whistled. "Remind me never to arm wrestle you."

"Don't celebrate yet," Kaelen pointed.

From the side streets, more figures were emerging. But these weren't assassins. They were soldiers. Royal Guards. Dozens of them. But their eyes... they had that same cold, glassy look as the ones in the tavern.

"Mind control?" Lyra asked, horrified. "Or just corruption?"

"A bit of both, I suspect," Kaelen said, drawing his swords. "We're trapped."

## Part 3: The Truth Revealed

They were surrounded. On one side, the remaining Shadow Assassins dropped from the roofs. On the other, the corrupted Royal Guard advanced with shields raised. The plaza was a kill box.

"We fight," Kaelen said, stepping back until his shoulder brushed Drakon's armor. "Back to back."

They formed a tight triangle. Kaelen facing the guards, Drakon facing the assassins, Lyra in the center covering the flanks with her crossbow.

"This is going to be a good death!" Drakon declared, loosening his massive war-axe from his back. "I shall sing of it in the afterlife! The ballad of the Dragon and his tiny friends!"

"Let's try to sing about it in a pub later tonight instead," Lyra suggested, her hands trembling slightly as she reloaded. "I prefer wine to valhalla."

The enemy charged.

It was a blur of steel and magic. Kaelen fought with a desperation he hadn't felt in years. He parried, slashed, and dodged. The guards were skilled, trained soldiers. He didn't want to kill them—they were his countrymen, potentially under a spell—but they gave him no choice.

*System Alert: Stamina draining rapidly. Adrenaline levels critical.*

He aimed for non-lethal strikes where he could—pommel smashes to the temple, knee-capping kicks—but the sheer number of them was overwhelming.

"Lyra! The letter!" Kaelen shouted over the din of battle, parrying a spear thrust. "Is it safe?"

"It's in my corset!" she yelled back, firing a bolt into a guard's shoulder. "Unless they're getting very fresh, it's safe! And if they try, I'll bite them!"

Suddenly, a horn blast cut through the noise. It was a deep, resonant sound that seemed to shake the very air.

The fighting stopped. Everyone looked up.

On the balcony of the Royal Palace, overlooking the plaza, a figure stood. It was a herald, dressed in black and silver, flanked by two high-ranking generals.

"Citizens of Arcanis!" the herald announced. "Hear the Royal Decree!"

The crowd, cowering in doorways, looked up.

"Due to the cowardly attack on our border villages..." the herald paused for effect. "...and the confirmed evidence of aggression... The Kingdom of Eldoria hereby declares WAR on the Kingdom of Aridia!"

Kaelen froze. His sword tip lowered.

"No," he whispered. "We were too late."

The herald continued. "General Malakor has already been dispatched to the front! Victory for Eldoria!"

A cheer went up from the confused crowd. War fever. It was infectious. They didn't know it was a lie. They didn't know they were cheering for their own doom. They just heard 'Victory' and 'War' and let their fear turn into aggression.

The assassins and guards in the plaza slowly backed away, melting into the cheering crowd. Their job was done. The distraction had worked. The war was started.

"We failed," Lyra said, lowering her crossbow. Her voice was hollow. She looked small suddenly.

Kaelen sheathed his swords. He felt a heavy weight settle in his gut. The letter... it was useless now. The declaration had been made. The armies would march.

"It was a setup," Kaelen realized. "The chase... the assassins... it was all to keep us busy while they pushed the decree through. We were just pawns. A distraction."

Drakon looked around, confused. "But... we have the proof! The letter says it is a lie! Why do they cheer?"

"Because they are afraid," Kaelen said bitterly. "And fear makes people stupid. Once the war drums start beating, nobody listens to a piece of paper. The momentum is unstoppable."

He looked up at the palace balcony. The herald was gone. But Kaelen saw a shadow moving behind the curtains. A figure watching them. A figure with burning red eyes.

*System Alert: High Threat Detected. Demon Class Entity.*

"This isn't over," Kaelen vowed. "They started their war. But they made a mistake."

"What mistake?" Lyra asked, looking at him with concern.

"They let us live," Kaelen said. "Come on. We need to leave the city. Arcanis isn't safe anymore. And if we're going to stop this, we need to go to the front."

"The front?" Drakon asked. "To fight?"

"To find the truth," Kaelen said. "And to find someone who will listen. Someone powerful enough to stop a war."

## Part 4: The Long Walk

The escape from Arcanis was surprisingly easy. With the war announcement, the gates were thrown open for military convoys. Kaelen, Lyra, and Drakon slipped out amidst a column of supply wagons, disguised in stolen cloaks.

They walked in silence for miles, putting the gleaming city behind them. The road was filled with refugees—people fleeing the capital in fear of reprisal attacks, and soldiers marching towards the border.

The mood was somber. They had lost the first round.

As night fell, they made camp off the main road, in a small grove of trees. The fire crackled, casting dancing shadows on their faces.

Drakon started a fire, roasting a rabbit he had caught with impressive dexterity for someone with such large hands. Lyra sat polishing her bolts, her usual humor absent.

Kaelen sat staring into the flames. He felt the weight of failure. He had the letter. He had the skills. And yet, the world was burning anyway.

"So," Lyra said finally, breaking the silence. She didn't look up from her crossbow. "We're going to war. I didn't sign up for this, you know. I signed up for... well, I didn't sign up for anything. I just wanted some wine. And maybe some fun."

"You can leave," Kaelen said without looking up. "Go back to the city. Hide. Survive."

Lyra looked at him. She stopped polishing. "Is that what you want? To be the lone wolf again? Dying heroically in a ditch somewhere?"

"It's safer for you," Kaelen said.

Lyra scoffed. She crawled over to him, sitting beside him on the log. She bumped his shoulder with hers. "Safer? Maybe. But boring. And I hate being bored."

She sighed and leaned back, looking up at the stars. "Besides. If what you say is true... about the Shadows and the Demon King... there's nowhere to hide, is there?"

"No," Kaelen said. "There isn't."

"Then I stick with the big guy," she pointed at Drakon. "He seems durable."

Drakon beamed, tearing a leg off the rabbit. "I am very durable! And I have decided... I like this 'party'. You are small and squishy, but you fight well. We shall be... the Dragon's Fangs!"

"We are not calling ourselves that," Lyra said immediately.

"The Scale Breakers?"

"No."

"The Hungry Trio?"

"Better," Lyra admitted, smiling slightly. "But still no."

Kaelen smiled. A faint, tired smile. He looked at Lyra. In the firelight, she looked softer, less guarded.

"Thank you," he said quietly.

"For what?"

"For staying."

Lyra held his gaze. For a moment, the banter stopped. There was just the crackle of the fire and the shared understanding of two people standing on the edge of a precipice.

"Don't make me regret it, hero," she whispered.

She leaned in, and for a second, Kaelen thought she might kiss him. The tension was palpable, a magnetic pull. But then Drakon let out a massive belch.

"Excuse me!" Drakon announced. "The rabbit was rich."

Lyra burst out laughing, the moment broken but the warmth remaining. Kaelen chuckled, shaking his head.

"Get some rest," he told them. "Tomorrow, we reach the border. And tomorrow, we see what this war really looks like."

He looked up at the stars. Somewhere out there, the pieces were moving. The Demon Generals were waking up. The Alliance was fracturing before it even formed.

But as he looked at his companions—a snoring dragon and an elf checking her nails—he felt a spark of hope.

It wasn't the Alliance of Light yet. But it was a start.
