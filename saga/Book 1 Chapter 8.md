# Chapter 8: The Demon Generals

## Prologue: The Fire and the Void

*Location: Alliance Camp, Main Pavilion*
*Time: Seconds after the Breach*

The world was fire.

The Hellfire that Malakor summoned wasn't normal flame. It was sticky, clinging to flesh and wood alike, burning with a heat that ignored armor. The screams of the dying were drowned out by the roar of the inferno.

Kaelen crouched behind the overturned table. The wood was already smoking.

"We can't stay here!" Lyra yelled over the noise. She popped up, firing a bolt into a charging imp's eye, then ducked back down as a fireball wooshed overhead.

"The exit is blocked!" Drakon reported. He was holding the table up like a shield, his scales glowing red from the heat. "The big one... he is standing in the doorway!"

Malakor was indeed blocking the main exit. He was dismantling the Royal Guard with terrifying ease. He caught a spear with one hand, snapped it, and backhanded the wielder across the room.

"Where is the Priestess?" Malakor bellowed. "Bring me the Light-Wielder!"

Elfiria was cowering behind Drakon, her hands shaking as she tried to weave a protection spell. "I... I can't focus! The dark mana is too thick!"

"We have to make a hole," Kaelen said, his eyes scanning the tent. He saw a support pole. "Drakon! The central pillar! If you break it, the tent collapses!"

"On us?" Drakon asked.

"On *him*," Kaelen pointed. "We go out the back!"

"I like this plan!" Drakon roared.

He dropped the table and charged—not at the demons, but at the massive wooden pillar in the center of the pavilion.

"TIMBER!"

Drakon slammed his shoulder into the wood. *CRACK.* The pillar snapped.

The heavy canvas roof, weighed down by iron chandeliers, came crashing down. It draped over Malakor and his minions, momentarily blinding and entangling them.

"Go! Cut the back wall!" Kaelen ordered.

Lyra slashed the canvas with her daggers. They tumbled out into the cool night air.

But the nightmare wasn't over. The entire camp was burning.

## Part 1: The Running Battle

The camp was chaos. Soldiers were running in every direction. Demons were dropping from the sky—Gargoyles snatching men up and dropping them from heights.

"Make for the canyon!" Kaelen shouted, grabbing Elfiria's hand. "We can bottle-neck them there!"

They sprinted through the burning rows of tents. A Hellhound leaped at Kaelen from the shadows.

*Slash.*

Kaelen decapitated it mid-air without breaking stride.

"Behind us!" Lyra screamed.

Malakor had torn his way out of the tent. He was furious. His black armor was covered in soot, and his eyes burned like twin suns.

"You think a blanket can stop me?" Malakor roared. He raised his greatsword. "I will flay you all!"

He charged. He moved faster than a creature of his size should be able to. He was gaining on them.

"He's too fast!" Elfiria cried.

"Lyra! Caltrops!" Kaelen ordered.

Lyra reached into her pouch and scattered a handful of jagged metal stars behind them.

Malakor didn't even slow down. His iron boots crushed the caltrops into the dirt.

"Okay, he has really good boots," Lyra noted, panic rising in her voice.

They reached the canyon entrance—a narrow pass between two cliffs.

"Drakon! Collapse the entrance!"

"I am running out of things to break!" Drakon complained, but he slammed his axe into the cliff wall.

Rocks rained down, creating a barrier.

They stopped, gasping for air.

"Did... did we lose him?" Elfiria wheezed.

*BOOM.*

A fist of black iron punched through the rock pile.

"Knock knock," Malakor's voice came through the hole.

He tore the rocks apart. He stepped through, dusting off his pauldrons. He was alone. He had left his army behind. He wanted this kill for himself.

"Now," Malakor smiled, revealing shark-like teeth. "Now we have fun."

## Part 2: The Impossible Fight

"We have to fight," Kaelen realized. "There's nowhere left to run."

He drew his swords. "Formation Delta! Drakon, take the heat! Lyra, eyes and joints! Elfiria, buff us!"

"For glory!" Drakon roared and charged.

He swung his axe in a massive overhead arc. Malakor caught the axe handle with one hand. Stopped it dead.

"Weak," Malakor sneered.

He punched Drakon in the gut. The force lifted the 300-pound dragon-kin off the ground and sent him flying into the canyon wall. Drakon slumped, winded.

"Drakon!" Lyra screamed. She fired two bolts.

*Ping. Ping.*

They bounced off Malakor's chest plate.

"Annoying fly," Malakor turned to her. He raised a hand. *Shadow Grip.*

Lyra was lifted into the air, clutching her throat. Invisible fingers were choking her.

"Let her go!" Kaelen activated *Blade Dance*.

He was a blur. He slashed at Malakor's legs, his arms, his back. Sparks flew. He managed to find a gap in the armor at the back of the knee.

*Critical Hit.*

Malakor grunted and dropped to one knee. The spell on Lyra broke. She fell, gasping.

"You..." Malakor swatted at Kaelen.

Kaelen ducked, but the backswing caught him. He was thrown backward, sliding through the dirt.

Malakor stood up. He looked at the cut on his leg. Black blood oozed out.

"You made me bleed," Malakor said, his voice low and dangerous. "Good. I haven't bled in a century."

He raised his sword. The blade ignited with black fire.

"Now burn."

He swung. A wave of fire rolled towards Kaelen.

"Shield of Light!" Elfiria stepped in front of Kaelen. She raised her staff. A barrier of gold light appeared.

The fire hit the shield. The barrier crackled, hissed, and shattered.

Elfiria was thrown back, her robes scorched.

"Elfiria!" Kaelen scrambled to her.

She was unconscious. Drakon was down. Lyra was choking.

It was over.

Malakor walked towards Kaelen slowly. "This is the 'Hope' of the Alliance? Pathetic."

Kaelen looked at his broken sword. He looked at his fallen friends.

*System Alert: Limit Break Available.*
*Condition: Despair.*
*Activate? Y/N.*

"Yes," Kaelen whispered.

He stood up. His eyes turned a glowing grey.

*Skill: Overclock.*

Time slowed. He could see the mana flowing around Malakor. He could see the cracks in his armor.

Kaelen didn't attack Malakor. He attacked the environment.

He sprinted past Malakor, running up the canyon wall. He reached a massive stalactite hanging directly above the General.

He slashed the base of the rock.

"What?" Malakor looked up.

Gravity took over. The ten-ton rock fell.

Malakor tried to catch it. He was strong, but not that strong.

*CRUNCH.*

The rock smashed him into the ground.

Silence.

Then, a groan.

The rock shifted. Malakor began to lift it. His armor was crushed. His helmet was gone. One of his horns was broken. But he was alive.

"Run," Kaelen grabbed Elfiria. "Lyra, help Drakon! Move!"

They limped away while Malakor was pinned.

## Part 3: The Aftermath

They didn't stop until dawn. They found a small cave miles away from the camp.

They collapsed.

Lyra was coughing, her neck bruised purple. "He... he was a monster."

Drakon was nursing his ribs. "He hit harder than a Troll. I do not like him."

Elfiria woke up. She looked around, confused. "What happened?"

"We survived," Kaelen said. He was bandaging his hands. They were raw from the impact.

"The camp?"

"Gone," Kaelen said. "The Alliance... scattered."

Elfiria buried her face in her hands and wept.

Kaelen watched the sunrise. It was blood red.

They had lost the battle. They had lost the army. But they had learned something.

"He bleeds," Kaelen said softly.

"What?" Lyra asked.

"Malakor. I cut him. He bleeds."

Kaelen looked at his friends. "If it bleeds, we can kill it."

"With what?" Lyra asked bitterly. "We have sticks. He has Hellfire."

"We get bigger sticks," Kaelen said. "We find Aric. We regroup."

It was a faint hope. But it was all they had.

*System Alert: Chapter Completed.*
*World State Update: Alliance Army Destroyed. Malakor Wounded.*
*Party Status: Critical Condition.*
*Achievement: Survived a General.*
