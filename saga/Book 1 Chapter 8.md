# Chapter 8: The Demon Generals

## Prologue: The Fire and the Void

*Location: Alliance Camp, Main Pavilion*
*Time: Seconds after the Breach*

The world was fire.

The Hellfire that Malakor summoned wasn't normal flame. It was sticky, clinging to flesh and wood alike, burning with a heat that ignored armor. It was a physical manifestation of hatred. The screams of the dying were drowned out by the roar of the inferno and the manic laughter of the Demon General.

Kaelen crouched behind the overturned table, the oak shielding him from the worst of the heat. The wood was already smoking, the varnish bubbling.

"We can't stay here!" Lyra yelled over the noise. She popped up, firing a bolt into a charging imp's eye, then ducked back down as a fireball wooshed overhead, singing her hair. "My bolts are melting!"

"The exit is blocked!" Drakon reported. He was holding the table up like a shield, his scales glowing red from the heat. "The big one... he is standing in the doorway! He is killing everyone!"

Malakor was indeed blocking the main exit. He was dismantling the Royal Guard with terrifying ease. He caught a spear with one hand, snapped it like a twig, and backhanded the wielder across the room with enough force to shatter the stone pillar behind him.

"Where is the Priestess?" Malakor bellowed, his voice a landslide of gravel and malice. "Bring me the Light-Wielder! I want to taste her soul!"

Elfiria was cowering behind Drakon, her hands shaking as she tried to weave a protection spell. "I... I can't focus! The dark mana is too thick! It's like breathing tar!"

"We have to make a hole," Kaelen said, his eyes scanning the tent. He saw a support pole—one of the main ones holding up the heavy canvas roof. "Drakon! The central pillar! If you break it, the tent collapses!"

"On us?" Drakon asked, blinking.

"On *him*," Kaelen pointed. "We go out the back! Lyra, cut the canvas!"

"I like this plan!" Drakon roared.

He dropped the table and charged—not at the demons, but at the massive wooden pillar in the center of the pavilion.

"TIMBER!"

Drakon slammed his shoulder into the wood. *CRACK.* The pillar snapped.

The heavy canvas roof, weighed down by iron chandeliers and burning debris, came crashing down. It draped over Malakor and his minions, momentarily blinding and entangling them.

"Go! Cut the back wall!" Kaelen ordered.

Lyra slashed the canvas with her daggers. They tumbled out into the cool night air.

But the nightmare wasn't over. The entire camp was burning. It looked like the mouth of a volcano had opened up beneath the Valley of Kings.

"My squad," Kaelen gasped, looking back at the inferno. "Rylan... Elara..."

"We cannot help them," Drakon said, grabbing Kaelen's shoulder. His grip was iron hard. "If we go back, we die. And if we die, the Princess dies."

Kaelen looked at Elfiria. She was in shock, staring at the flames with wide, unseeing eyes. She was muttering a prayer that no god was answering.

"Right," Kaelen swallowed the bile in his throat. "Right. Move."

***

## Part 1: The Running Battle

The camp was chaos. Soldiers were running in every direction, their formations broken. Demons were dropping from the sky—Gargoyles snatching men up and dropping them from heights to shatter on the hard ground.

"Make for the canyon!" Kaelen shouted, grabbing Elfiria's hand. "We can bottle-neck them there! The terrain is narrow!"

They sprinted through the burning rows of tents. The air was thick with the smell of roasting meat and sulfur.

A group of Imps, chattering like manic monkeys, jumped out from behind a supply wagon. They threw balls of green fire.

"Drakon! Bowling!" Kaelen yelled.

Drakon didn't ask questions. He grabbed the burning wagon by its axle and swung it like a flail.

*CRASH.*

The wagon pulverized the Imps.

"Strike!" Drakon roared, though his voice was tight with fear.

They turned a corner and ran straight into a squad of Bone Knights—skeletal warriors in rusted armor wielding jagged scimitars.

"Elfiria! Light!" Kaelen ordered.

"I... I can't..." she stammered.

"Do it or we die!" Lyra slapped the Princess on the cheek. Hard.

Elfiria blinked. The shock broke. She raised her staff.

*Spell: Sunburst.*

A flash of blinding light erupted from her staff. The Bone Knights shrieked as the holy energy burned their bones. They crumbled into dust.

"Keep moving!" Kaelen pushed them forward.

"Help! Someone help us!"

A scream cut through the chaos. Kaelen looked to his left. A squad of Eldorian soldiers was pinned down by a pack of Hellhounds. They were backed against a burning supply tent.

"We have to keep moving," Lyra said, grabbing Kaelen's arm. "We can't save everyone."

Kaelen looked at the soldiers. They were young. Terrified.

"I can save them," Kaelen said.

"Kaelen, no!"

He didn't listen. He broke away from the group and charged.

"Hey! Mutt!"

The Hellhounds turned. Their eyes were burning coals.

Kaelen slid on his knees, slicing the hamstrings of the nearest hound. It howled and fell.

"Form a phalanx!" Kaelen ordered the soldiers. "Shields up! Spears out!"

The soldiers, seeing a Commander, instinctively obeyed. They locked shields.

"Push!"

They marched forward, driving the hounds back into the fire.

"Go! Get to the river!" Kaelen shouted.

The soldiers ran. One of them saluted Kaelen. "Thank you, sir!"

Kaelen turned to rejoin his friends. But the delay had cost him.

A Shadow Stalker materialized in front of him. It was a creature of smoke and blades.

*Slash.*

It cut Kaelen's arm.

*Poison Detected.*

Kaelen gritted his teeth. He parried the next blow and kicked the Stalker in the chest. It dissipated into mist.

"Kaelen!" Elfiria was screaming.

He ran back to them, clutching his bleeding arm.

"You idiot," Lyra hissed, checking the wound. "You noble, stupid idiot."

"They got away," Kaelen panted. "Worth it."

They reached the edge of the camp. The canyon was just ahead. But standing between them and salvation was a Succubus. She was beautiful, terrible, and holding a whip made of shadow.

"Going somewhere, handsome?" she purred, looking at Kaelen.

*System Alert: Mental Attack Detected. Charm Effect.*

Kaelen felt his legs grow heavy. She was... stunning. Why run? Why not stay?

"Kaelen!" Lyra's voice sounded far away.

The Succubus walked closer. "Give me a kiss."

*Effect: 50%... 70%...*

"No," Kaelen gritted his teeth. He bit his own tongue. The pain cleared his mind.

*Effect: Cleansed.*

"I prefer brunettes," Kaelen spat blood. He threw a dagger. It took the Succubus in the throat. She gargled black blood and collapsed, her beauty melting away to reveal a withered hag.

"Nice aim," Lyra said, sounding relieved. "I thought we lost you there."

"Almost," Kaelen admitted.

"Behind us!" Elfiria screamed.

Malakor had torn his way out of the tent. He was furious. His black armor was covered in soot, and his eyes burned like twin suns. He threw the wreckage of a siege engine aside as if it were a toy.

"You think a blanket can stop me?" Malakor roared. He raised his greatsword. "I will flay you all! I will wear your skins as a cloak!"

He charged. He moved faster than a creature of his size should be able to. Each step cracked the earth. He was gaining on them.

"He's too fast!" Elfiria cried, stumbling over a dead soldier.

"Lyra! Caltrops!" Kaelen ordered.

Lyra reached into her pouch and scattered a handful of jagged metal stars behind them. They were coated in paralyzing venom.

Malakor didn't even slow down. His iron boots crushed the caltrops into the dirt.

"Okay, he has really good boots," Lyra noted, panic rising in her voice. "And presumably immune to wyvern poison."

"Look out!" Drakon shoved Lyra aside.

A Gargoyle swooped down from the smoke, its stone claws raking the ground where she had stood.

*System Alert: Aerial Threat. Gargoyle (Level 12).*

"It's trying to grab Elfiria!" Kaelen shouted.

The Gargoyle banked, its stony wings flapping heavily. It dove for the Princess.

"Not today, rocky!" Drakon grabbed the Gargoyle's tail as it passed.

He was lifted off the ground, but his weight dragged the creature down. They crashed into a burning tent.

"Get off me!" the Gargoyle screeched in a voice like grinding gravel.

"No!" Drakon punched it in the face. "You fly bad!"

He ripped one of its wings off with a sickening *crack*. The Gargoyle dissolved into dust.

"Nice catch," Kaelen said, pulling Drakon up.

"It tasted like dust," Drakon spat.

They reached the canyon entrance—a narrow pass between two cliffs. It was a natural choke point.

"Drakon! Collapse the entrance!"

"I am running out of things to break!" Drakon complained, but he slammed his axe into the cliff wall. He hit a stress point he had noticed earlier (dragon instinct).

Rocks rained down, creating a barrier of boulders and dust.

They stopped, gasping for air.

"Did... did we lose him?" Elfiria wheezed, leaning against the canyon wall.

*BOOM.*

A fist of black iron punched through the rock pile.

"Knock knock," Malakor's voice came through the hole.

He tore the rocks apart. He stepped through, dusting off his pauldrons. He was alone. He had left his army behind. He wanted this kill for himself.

"Now," Malakor smiled, revealing shark-like teeth. "Now we have fun."

*Flashback: 1000 Years Ago.*
*Location: The Abyss.*

*Malakor was smaller then. He was an Imp, scraping for scraps at the table of greater demons.*

*"You are weak," an Ogre demon sneered, kicking him.*

*Malakor hissed and bit the Ogre's ankle. The Ogre laughed and stomped on him.*

*Then, the shadow fell.*

*Azezel stood over them. He didn't look at the Ogre. He looked at the broken Imp.*

*"Hunger," Azezel said. "I see hunger in your eyes, little one."*

*"I want... to eat him," Malakor whispered, pointing at the Ogre.*

*"Then eat," Azezel granted him a spark of power.*

*Malakor grew. His skin hardened. He tore the Ogre apart and feasted.*

*End Flashback.*

Malakor shook his head, the memory fading. He looked at the three mortals before him. They were small. Weak. But they had fire in their eyes.

"Hunger," Malakor whispered. "I remember hunger."

***

## Interlude: The Fallen General

*Location: The Burning Camp*
*Time: The Last Stand*

General Marcus watched the demons swarm. His legion was broken. His men were dying.

He stood atop a pile of corpses—both human and demon. His armor was shattered. His left arm hung uselessly at his side. But his sword, *Lion's Roar*, was still in his right hand.

"Come on!" he roared at the encroaching horde. "Is that all you have? I am Marcus of Eldoria! I am the Iron Wall!"

A Bone Knight lunged. Marcus decapitated it. An Imp jumped at his face. He caught it and crushed its skull.

He saw the refugees escaping towards the river. He saw Kaelen's group reach the canyon.

"Go," Marcus whispered. "Live."

A shadow fell over him. A new demon approached. Not Malakor. Another General. This one was slender, made of blades and silence.

"You are loud," the Blade General whispered.

Marcus laughed. He coughed blood. "And you are ugly."

He charged. It was a suicide run. He knew it.

The Blade General moved. A flash of silver.

Marcus stopped. He looked down. A blade of shadow was protruding from his chest.

"For the Kingdom," Marcus wheezed.

He detonated the mana crystal in his belt.

*BOOM.*

The explosion leveled the center of the camp, taking hundreds of demons with him.

But the Blade General just stepped back into the shadows. He reappeared ten feet away, untouched.

"Noble," the demon whispered. "But futile."

He walked over to the crater where Marcus had died. He picked up the shattered remains of *Lion's Roar*.

"A trophy for the Master," he said, vanishing into the darkness.

***

## Part 2: The Impossible Fight

"We have to fight," Kaelen realized. "There's nowhere left to run. The canyon ends in a drop."

He drew his swords. "Formation Delta! Drakon, take the heat! Lyra, eyes and joints! Elfiria, buff us! Don't try to kill him, just slow him down!"

"For glory!" Drakon roared and charged.

He swung his axe in a massive overhead arc. Malakor caught the axe handle with one hand. Stopped it dead.

"Weak," Malakor sneered.

He punched Drakon in the gut. The force lifted the 300-pound dragon-kin off the ground and sent him flying into the canyon wall. Drakon slumped, winded, his axe clattering away.

*System Alert: Ally Down. Drakon HP: 40%.*

"Drakon!" Lyra screamed. She fired two bolts.

*Ping. Ping.*

They bounced off Malakor's chest plate.

"Annoying fly," Malakor turned to her. He raised a hand. *Shadow Grip.*

Lyra was lifted into the air, clutching her throat. Invisible fingers were choking her. Her legs kicked helplessly.

"Let her go!" Kaelen activated *Blade Dance*.

He was a blur. He slashed at Malakor's legs, his arms, his back. Sparks flew as steel met demon iron. He managed to find a gap in the armor at the back of the knee.

*Critical Hit.*

Malakor grunted and dropped to one knee. The spell on Lyra broke. She fell, gasping, massaging her bruised throat.

"You..." Malakor swatted at Kaelen.

Kaelen ducked, but the backswing caught him. He was thrown backward, sliding through the dirt.

Malakor stood up. He looked at the cut on his leg. Black blood oozed out.

"You made me bleed," Malakor said, his voice low and dangerous. "Good. I haven't bled in a century. It reminds me I'm alive."

He raised his sword. The blade ignited with black fire.

"Now burn."

He swung. A wave of fire rolled towards Kaelen.

"Shield of Light!" Elfiria stepped in front of Kaelen. She raised her staff. A barrier of gold light appeared.

The fire hit the shield. The barrier crackled, hissed, and shattered like glass.

Elfiria was thrown back, her robes scorched. She hit the ground and didn't move.

"Elfiria!" Kaelen scrambled to her.

She was unconscious. Drakon was down. Lyra was choking.

It was over.

Malakor walked towards Kaelen slowly. "This is the 'Hope' of the Alliance? Pathetic. Your light is a candle in a hurricane."

Kaelen looked at his broken sword. He looked at his fallen friends. He felt a cold rage building in his chest.

*System Alert: Limit Break Available.*
*Condition: Despair.*
*Activate? Y/N.*

"Yes," Kaelen whispered.

He stood up. His eyes turned a glowing grey.

*Skill: Overclock.*

Time slowed. He could see the mana flowing around Malakor. He could see the cracks in his armor. He could hear the demon's heartbeat.

Kaelen didn't attack Malakor. He attacked the environment.

He sprinted past Malakor, running up the canyon wall. He reached a massive stalactite hanging directly above the General. It was loose.

He slashed the base of the rock.

"What?" Malakor looked up.

Gravity took over. The ten-ton rock fell.

Malakor tried to catch it. He was strong, but not that strong.

*CRUNCH.*

The rock smashed him into the ground. Dust billowed out.

Silence.

Then, a groan.

The rock shifted. Malakor began to lift it. His armor was crushed. His helmet was gone. One of his horns was broken. But he was alive.

"Run," Kaelen grabbed Elfiria. "Lyra, help Drakon! Move!"

They limped away while Malakor was pinned.

"Cowards!" Malakor roared from beneath the rubble. "Is this your Alliance? Running like rats?"

Kaelen didn't look back. There was no honor in suicide.

But Malakor was not done.

*ROAR.*

The pile of rocks exploded outward. Malakor burst free, his body glowing with red veins of power. He had entered Phase Two.

*System Alert: Enemy Enraged. Stats Doubled. Ability Unlocked: Summon Minions.*

"Rise!" Malakor slammed his fist into the ground.

Cracks appeared in the earth. From the fissures crawled Magma Golems—small, burning constructs of rock and lava.

"Oh, come on!" Drakon groaned. "Little fire men? Really?"

"Deal with them!" Kaelen ordered. "I'll distract the big guy!"

Drakon and Lyra engaged the Golems. Drakon smashed them with his fists, ignoring the burns. Lyra used water flasks to cool them into stone, then shattered them with her daggers.

Kaelen faced Malakor alone.

"You are persistent," Malakor admitted, walking towards him. "I will grant you a warrior's death."

"I'm busy today," Kaelen quipped. "Maybe next week?"

Malakor swung his sword. Kaelen dodged.

*Swing. Dodge. Swing. Dodge.*

Kaelen was dancing on the edge of a razor. One mistake, one slip, and he was dead.

"Elfiria! I need that spell!"

"I'm trying!" Elfiria was chanting, her hands glowing with white light. "It's a complex weave!"

"Simplify it!"

Malakor grabbed Kaelen by the throat.

"Caught you."

Kaelen gagged. His feet dangled in the air. Malakor squeezed.

*HP: 15%... 10%...*

"Now," Malakor smiled. "Pop."

*FLASH.*

A beam of pure, concentrated light hit Malakor in the face. *Solar Flare.*

"ARGH!" Malakor dropped Kaelen, clutching his eyes. "My eyes! It burns!"

Kaelen hit the ground, gasping.

"Run!" Elfiria screamed. She grabbed him and pulled him up.

"YOU CANNOT RUN!" Malakor screamed blindly. He threw his sword.

The massive blade spun through the air like a propeller.

"Down!" Kaelen tackled Elfiria.

The sword flew over their heads, embedding itself in the cliff face ahead of them, blocking the path.

"We're trapped," Lyra said, her voice hollow.

Malakor charged. He didn't need a sword. His fists were hammers.

"Elfiria," Kaelen whispered. "Do you have any mana left?"

"A drop," she wept. "Just a drop."

"Use it," Kaelen said. "Not on him. On the cliff."

"What?"

"The overhang! Bring it down!"

Elfiria looked up. A massive shelf of snow and ice hung over the pass.

"It will bury us too!"

"Better ice than fire," Kaelen said. "Do it!"

Elfiria raised her staff. She poured her life force into the spell.

*Spell: Sonic Lance.*

A beam of sound hit the snow.

*CRACK.*

The mountain groaned. Thousands of tons of snow and ice detached. An avalanche.

Malakor stopped. He looked up. For the first time, he looked unsure.

"Cover!" Kaelen dragged them into a small fissure in the rock wall.

The world turned white. The roar was deafening. The avalanche buried the pass, the demon, and the exit.

***

## Part 3: The Aftermath

They didn't stop until dawn. They found a small cave miles away from the camp, high in the mountains.

They collapsed.

Lyra was coughing, her neck bruised purple. "He... he was a monster. He played with us."

Drakon was nursing his ribs. "He hit harder than a Troll. I do not like him. I want to go home."

Elfiria woke up. She looked around, confused. "What happened? Where is the army?"

"We survived," Kaelen said. He was bandaging his hands. They were raw from the impact.

"The camp?"

"Gone," Kaelen said. "The Alliance... scattered. Malakor broke us."

Elfiria buried her face in her hands and wept. "All those men... Marcus... Zara..."

"Zara is alive," Drakon grunted. "I saw her dragging Grok to the river. Orcs are tough. They float well."

"Marcus isn't," Lyra said softly. "I saw him fall. He bought us time."

"He did his duty," Kaelen said, his voice flat. He felt numb. "Now we do ours."

"Our duty was to stop them!" Elfiria cried. "And we failed! We failed everyone!"

"We lost a battle, Elfiria," Kaelen grabbed her shoulders. "Not the war. Look at me. Are you dead?"

"No..."

"Is Drakon dead?"

"I am mostly alive," Drakon offered.

"Then we haven't failed yet," Kaelen said. "Failure is when you stop trying. We are not stopping."

Kaelen watched the sunrise. It was blood red. The smoke from the burning camp stained the horizon, a black scar against the morning sky.

They had lost the battle. They had lost the army. But they had learned something.

"He bleeds," Kaelen said softly.

"What?" Lyra asked.

"Malakor. I cut him. He bleeds."

Kaelen looked at his friends. "If it bleeds, we can kill it."

"With what?" Lyra asked bitterly. "We have sticks. He has Hellfire."

"We get bigger sticks," Kaelen said. "We find Aric. We regroup. This wasn't the war. This was just the opening move."

It was a faint hope. But it was all they had.

***

## Interlude: The King's Laugh

*Location: The Nether Throne*
*Time: Unknown*

Deep beneath the earth, in a palace made of obsidian and bone, the Demon King Azezel opened his eyes.

He felt the death of the Alliance army. It tasted like fine wine.

"Malakor has done well," he mused. His voice was the sound of continents grinding together.

"Shall I send the Second General to finish them?" a servant asked, a creature of pure shadow.

"No," Azezel smiled. "Let them run. Let them freeze. Fear is a better seasoning than death."

He looked at the map of the world carved into the floor. The lights of the Alliance were flickering out, one by one.

"The Sword Saint approaches," the servant warned.

"Aric," Azezel's eyes glowed with anticipation. "My old friend. Let him come. I have a special grave prepared for him."

***

## Epilogue: The Long Dark Continues

*Location: The High Mountains*
*Time: Three Days Later*

They were lost.

The blizzard had hit them on the second day. A magical storm, summoned by the demons to hunt survivors.

Kaelen trudged through the knee-deep snow. He was carrying Elfiria. She had a fever. Her magic was drained.

"Kaelen..." she murmured, shivering. "Are we there?"

"Almost," Kaelen lied. "Just a little further."

Drakon was lagging behind. His cold-blooded nature made the snow torture for him. He was grey, his movements sluggish.

"I am... sleepy," Drakon slurred.

"Don't sleep!" Lyra slapped his snout. Her hands were blue. "If you sleep, you turn into a popsicle!"

"Popsicle..." Drakon chuckled weakly. "Flavor?"

"Lizard flavor," Lyra said, blinking back tears. "Move your ass, Drakon!"

They found a crevice in the rock. It was small, cramped, but out of the wind.

They huddled together for warmth. Body heat was their only resource.

Kaelen looked at his friends. They were broken. Starving. Freezing.

*System Alert: Hypothermia Detected. HP draining slowly.*

*System Alert: Fatigue Level - Critical. Hallucinations Imminent.*

The shadows began to move. They whispered to him.

*"You should have died in the well, Kaelen."*

*"You let them die."*

*"You are not a hero. You are a gravedigger."*

Kaelen shook his head. "Shut up."

He saw a figure in the darkness. His mother. She was burning.

"Help me, Kaelen," she whispered.

"You're not real," Kaelen said, walking past her. The heat of the phantom fire felt real on his skin.

He saw the Shadow Captain.

"You cannot run from your nature," the Captain hissed.

"I'm not running," Kaelen said. "I'm shopping."

He pushed past the ghosts. He focused on the task. Find food. Find weapons. Survive.

He reached into his pack. He pulled out a single, frozen apple.

"Dinner," he said, cutting it into four pieces.

"A feast," Drakon whispered, taking his slice with trembling hands.

They ate in silence. The apple was mealy and cold, but it tasted like hope.

"We need fire," Kaelen said. "Elfiria?"

"I... I can try." She held out a shaking hand. A tiny spark of light appeared. It wasn't heat, but it was light.

It revealed the walls of the cave. They were covered in ancient paintings. Primitive drawings of men fighting... demons?

"This isn't just a cave," Lyra whispered, tracing a drawing. "It's a tomb."

"Or a bunker," Kaelen said. "From the First Era."

He saw a symbol on the wall. A sunburst.

"This is an old Aetherian outpost," he realized. "There might be supplies deeper in."

"I cannot walk," Drakon said.

"I'll go," Kaelen stood up, his legs screaming in protest. "Stay here. Keep the light alive."

He walked into the dark.

The air in the deeper tunnels was stale, but warmer. Kaelen followed the markings on the wall. They led him down, deep into the mountain's roots.

He found a heavy iron door. It was rusted shut.

"Come on," Kaelen gritted his teeth and pulled.

*Strength Check: Success.*

The door creaked open.

Inside was a storeroom. Dust covered everything. But on the shelves...

"Jackpot," Kaelen whispered.

Crates. Sealed crates.

He pried one open. Dried meat. Hardtack. It was centuries old, preserved by magic.

He opened another. Blankets. Wool, thick and warm.

And in the corner... a weapon rack. Most of the weapons had rusted to dust. But one remained.

A short sword. Its blade was made of a strange, blue metal. It glowed faintly in the dark.

*System Analysis: Item Found.*
*Name: Frost-Bite.*
*Grade: Rare.*
*Attribute: Ice.*
*Effect: Slows enemies on hit.*

Kaelen picked it up. It was light, balanced perfectly.

"Malakor likes fire," Kaelen smiled grimly. "Let's see how he likes ice."

He gathered as much food and blankets as he could carry and headed back up.

When he returned to the crevice, Elfiria was asleep, her head on Drakon's shoulder. Lyra was awake, watching the entrance with a dagger in her hand.

She saw the food. Her eyes widened.

"You found it," she whispered.

"We eat tonight," Kaelen said, dropping the supplies. He draped a blanket over Elfiria.

"And tomorrow?" Lyra asked, taking a piece of jerky.

Kaelen touched the hilt of the blue sword.

"Tomorrow," he said. "We hunt."

But as the wind howled outside, sounding like the screams of the damned, Kaelen wondered if tomorrow would ever come.

But as he looked at his sleeping friends, he knew one thing.

He would not hide in the well again.

He would burn the world down to keep them safe.

*System Alert: Chapter Completed.*
*World State Update: Alliance Army Destroyed. Malakor Wounded. General Marcus KIA.*
*Party Status: Critical Condition. Hypothermia.*
*Achievement: Survived a General.*
